McAdam, Judge\n\n\n\n                     Opinion by Justice Goff\nChief Justice Rush and Justices Massa, Slaughter, and Molter concur.\n\fGoff, Justice.\n\n   The Indiana Constitution limits a taxpayer’s property-tax liability to a\ncertain percentage of the property’s gross assessed value depending on\nthe class of property. For “[t]angible property, including curtilage, used as\na principal place of residence,” a taxpayer’s liability “may not exceed one\npercent” of the property’s gross assessed value. 1 In implementing this\nconstitutional tax cap, the Indiana Tax Code effectively limits a\nhomeowner’s property-tax liability for the “homestead” to one percent. 2\nThe Tax Code defines “homestead,” in pertinent part, as the dwelling and\nreal estate, “not exceeding one (1) acre,” immediately surrounding the\ndwelling. 3\n\n   The taxpayers here, owners of a home situated on 3.981 acres of land,\nargue that the one-acre size limit on the “homestead” is unconstitutional\nas applied to them because their curtilage exceeds one acre. We hold that,\neven if a person’s curtilage could extend beyond one acre for tax\npurposes, the taxpayers here failed to show their excess property is\ncurtilage and, thus, they failed to carry the burden of proving their\nconstitutional claim. Accordingly, we reverse the Tax Court’s judgment\nand remand with instructions to affirm the Indiana Board of Tax Review’s\ndetermination in favor of the Lake County Assessor.\n\n\nFacts and Procedural History\n   Tulsi and Kamini Sawlani (the Taxpayers) own a two-story home\nsituated on 3.981 acres of land in Crown Point, Indiana. The home is\nlocated in a gated community with a security guard, and access to the\ncommunity is generally limited to residents and their guests. There is a\nfence surrounding the entire community but no fence on the Taxpayers’\nproperty. The Taxpayers have also retained trees on the property for\n\n\n\n1   Ind. Const. art 10, §§ 1(c)(4), (f)(1) (emphasis added).\n2   Ind. Code § 6-1.1-20.6-7.5(a)(1) (2019).\n3   I.C. § 6-1.1-12-37(k)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025       Page 2 of 11\n\fprivacy and to limit visibility from a neighboring subdivision, but the\ntrees do not form distinguishing boundaries around the entire lot. The\nTaxpayers desire privacy and say they use the entire parcel to maintain\nprivacy. For the 2019 tax assessment, the Lake County Assessor (or just\nAssessor) classified one acre as the “homestead” and applied a standard\ndeduction and supplemental credit, effectively taxing one acre at one\npercent of the gross assessed value of the property. See Ind. Code § 6-1.1-\n20.6-7.5(a)(1) (2019); I.C. § 6-1.1-12-37(k). But the Assessor classified the\nother 2.981 acres as non-residential property and applied a three-percent\ntax. See I.C. § 6-1.1-20.6-7.5(a)(5).\n\n   The Taxpayers petitioned the assessment to the Lake County Property\nTax Assessment Board of Appeals (the County Board). Though not\ndisputing the total assessed value of their property, the Taxpayers argued\nthat the one-acre size limit under code section 6-1.1-12-37(k) (or the\nHomestead Statute) violates Article 10, Section 1 of the Indiana\nConstitution. In their view, the additional 2.981 acres of property is\ncurtilage and is therefore also entitled to the one-percent tax cap under\nArticle 10, Section 1, making the Homestead Statute unconstitutional as\napplied to them. The County Board rejected Taxpayers’ claims, and the\nIndiana Board of Tax Review (the Board) affirmed. Though\nacknowledging that Taxpayers “may be correct that their 2.981 acres of\nexcess residential acreage could be considered ‘curtilage,’” the Board\nconcluded that it has no authority to declare a statute unconstitutional and\nis bound by the one-acre size limit in the Homestead Statute. App. Vol. 2,\np. 47. Taxpayers appealed to the Tax Court.\n\n  In a for-publication opinion, the Tax Court reversed the Board’s\ndetermination, concluding that “the Constitution does not permit a fixed\none-acre limitation on the amount of land eligible for the one percent tax\ncap.” Sawlani v. Lake Cnty. Assessor, 240 N.E.3d 734, 736 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2024).\nThe Tax Court reasoned that, because Article 10, Section 1 imposes no size\nlimit on a property’s “curtilage,” the Homestead Statute’s one-acre limit\ncould be unconstitutional as applied to some homeowners who own more\nthan one acre. Id. at 750–51. The Tax Court endorsed a “case-by-case\nevaluation” whereby taxpayers with more than one acre of land may\nappeal their assessments to determine whether the excess acreage\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025        Page 3 of 11\n\fqualifies as part of that taxpayer’s curtilage. Id. at 751. Because the Board\n“did not make sufficient factual findings” to determine whether the\nstatute is unconstitutional as applied to Taxpayers, the Tax Court\nremanded for further proceedings to determine whether Taxpayers’\nexcess acreage “is used as part of the [Taxpayers’] principal place of\nresidence, consistent with the statutory and constitutional frameworks.”\nId. at 752.\n\n   The Assessor sought review with this Court which we now grant\nthrough a separate order. See Ind. Appellate Rule 63(A). 4\n\n\nStandard of Review\n   This Court reviews the Tax Court’s decisions on the constitutionality of\na statute de novo. See State Bd. of Tax Comm'rs v. Town of St. John, 702\nN.E.2d 1034, 1037, 1039 (Ind. 1998); Horner v. Curry, 125 N.E.3d 584, 588\n(Ind. 2019).\n\n\nDiscussion and Decision\n    Under Article 10, Section 1 of the Indiana Constitution, “[t]he General\nAssembly shall, by law, limit a taxpayer’s property tax liability” in one of\nseveral ways, depending on the class of property involved. Ind. Const. art.\n10, §§ 1(c)(4), (f)(1). For “[t]angible property, including curtilage, used as a\nprincipal place of residence,” a taxpayer’s liability “may not exceed one\npercent (1%) of the gross assessed value of the property that is the basis\nfor the determination of property taxes.” Id. (emphasis added). This\nconstitutional tax cap is implemented through the Indiana Code. The\nHomestead Statute defines a homeowner’s “homestead,” in pertinent part,\nas a “dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that\n\n\n\n\n4Because the constitutionality of a state statute was called into question, we notified the State,\nand the Attorney General intervened. See I.C. § 34-33.1-1-1(a) (2024). We also received amicus\nbriefs from the Association of Indiana Counties, the Indiana Association of Realtors, Matthew\nSchiffler, and William Rainsberger. We thank them for their helpful submissions.\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025                         Page 4 of 11\n\fimmediately surrounds that dwelling” and is used as the “principal place\nof residence” of the homeowner. I.C. §§ 6-1.1-12-37(k)(1), (2) (emphasis\nadded). A person is entitled to a credit against their homestead’s property-\ntax liability in the amount by which the property tax exceeds one percent.\nI.C. § 6-1.1-20.6-7.5(a). In other words, property taxes on a homeowner’s\n“homestead” are effectively capped at one percent.\n\n   Taxpayers argue that, because the Constitution caps property taxes at\none percent for tangible property, “including curtilage,” used as a\nprincipal place of residence, and because some taxpayers may use more\nthan one acre of their property as curtilage, the Homestead Statute’s one-\nacre limit is unconstitutional as applied to them and others similarly\nsituated. 5 We ultimately conclude there is no need to determine if Article\n10, Section 1 permits a one-acre limit given that Taxpayers presented\ninsufficient evidence that they use their excess property as “curtilage.” We\ntherefore reverse the Tax Court’s judgment and remand with instructions\nto affirm the Board’s determination in favor of the Assessor.\n\n\nI. Even if “curtilage” has no size limit, the Taxpayers\n   fail to show how the Homestead Statute’s one-acre\n   limit is unconstitutional as applied to them.\n   Statutes are “clothed with the presumption of constitutionality until\nclearly overcome by a contrary showing.” Whistle Stop Inn, Inc. v. City of\nIndianapolis, 51 N.E.3d 195, 199 (Ind. 2016) (quoting Paul Stieler Enters., Inc.\nv. City of Evansville, 2 N.E.3d 1269, 1272–73 (Ind. 2014)). “The party\nchallenging the constitutionality of the statute bears the burden of proof,\n\n\n\n\n5The median lot size in Indiana is less than one acre. See How Lot Sizes Have Changed, Build\nIndiana Roots (Aug. 6, 2021), http://bit.ly/44GWPoR [https://perma.cc/52LD-XRTC]. So, for\nmost Hoosier homeowners, their entire property is taxed at one percent, and the Homestead\nStatute poses no constitutional issue. And because there’s “at least one circumstance under\nwhich the statute can be constitutionally applied,” a facial challenge to the statute would\nnecessarily fail. See Members of Med. Licensing Bd. of Ind. v. Planned Parenthood of Great Nw.,\nHaw., Alaska, Ind., Ky., Inc., 211 N.E.3d 957, 975 (Ind. 2023) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025                        Page 5 of 11\n\fand all doubts are resolved against that party.” State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs,\n702 N.E.2d at 1037. When “two reasonable interpretations of a statute are\navailable, one of which is constitutional and the other not, we will choose\nthat path which permits upholding the statute.” Id.\n\n    “When a question arises under our Constitution, this Court must\nexamine ‘the language of the text in the context of the history surrounding\nits drafting and ratification, the purpose and structure of our Constitution,\nand case law interpreting the specific provisions.’” Holcomb v. Bray, 187\nN.E.3d 1268, 1277 (Ind. 2022) (quoting Hoagland v. Franklin Twp. Cmty. Sch.\nCorp., 27 N.E.3d 737, 741 (Ind. 2015)). This Court approaches the words of\nthe Constitution with “particular deference, as though every word had\nbeen hammered into place.” Meredith v. Pence, 984 N.E.2d 1213, 1218 (Ind.\n2013) (quoting Embry v. O’Bannon, 798 N.E.2d 157, 160 (Ind. 2003)).\nConstitutional interpretation requires a search for “the common\nunderstanding of both those who framed it and those who ratified it.” Paul\nStieler Enters., Inc., 2 N.E.3d at 1273 (quoting City Chapel v. South Bend, 744\nN.E.2d 443, 447 (Ind. 2001)) (emphasis added).\n\n\n   A. The Taxpayers argue that the plain meaning of\n      “curtilage” has no size limit.\n   To discern the “common understanding” of the framers and ratifiers of\nthe constitutional provision, Taxpayers argue that we should look to the\nplain meaning of “curtilage.” The ordinary definition of “curtilage” is “a\nyard, courtyard, or other piece of ground included within a fence\nsurrounding a dwelling house.” Curtilage, Webster’s Third New Int’l\nDictionary 558 (2002 ed.). “Curtilage” also means “the area around a\nhouse that includes grounds, outbuildings, and fencing intimately\nassociated with domestic life in the house,” and has “no standard limits as\nto square footage or size or nature of what is put on the ground.” Curtilage,\nMellinkoff’s Dictionary of American Legal Usage 145 (1992) (emphasis\nadded). From these definitions, Taxpayers argue that the framers and\nratifiers understood “curtilage” to have no size limit.\n\n  Taxpayers also look at how other jurisdictions describe “curtilage” for\nproperty-tax-assessment purposes. In Bullis School, Inc. v. Appeal Tax Court\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025         Page 6 of 11\n\ffor Montgomery County, the property-tax exemption for farm buildings and\ncurtilage extended to thirty-four acres of a 285-acre farm. 114 A.2d 41, 42\n(Md. 1955). In McTague v. Monroe Township, two acres of a forty-acre\nparcel were exempt as curtilage because the area was reasonably required\nfor the “full enjoyment and occupancy of [the] dwelling.” 1 N.J. Tax 66, 68,\n72 (N.J. Tax Ct. 1980). And in Solebury Township Board of Supervisors v.\nBucks County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, twenty-five acres of\na 71.68-acre parcel constituted reasonable curtilage. 1966 WL 226518, at *1\n(Pa. Commw. Ct. Aug. 29, 1966). Based on this precedent from other\njurisdictions, Taxpayers argue “curtilage” can extend beyond one acre.\n\n   Instead of size, Taxpayers look to the four-factor test in United States v.\nDunn as a way to determine whether an area is curtilage. 480 U.S. 294, 301\n(1987). In Dunn, the United States Supreme Court held that the curtilage of\nthe home is protected against warrantless searches under the Fourth\nAmendment because an “individual reasonably may expect that the area\nin question should be treated as the home itself.” Id. at 300. Whether an\narea is “curtilage” for purposes of a search depends on (1) the proximity\nof the area to the home, (2) whether the area falls within an enclosure\nsurrounding the home, (3) the nature of the uses to which the area is put,\nand (4) the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation\nby passersby. Id. at 301. Therefore, according to Taxpayers, whether an\narea is curtilage generally depends on the use of the property.\n\n   Looking at the plain meaning of “curtilage,” and the application of\n“curtilage” in the tax-assessment and Fourth Amendment contexts,\nTaxpayers argue that curtilage has no fixed size limit. Therefore,\naccording to Taxpayers, the Homestead Statute’s one-acre limit is\nunconstitutional as applied to homeowners who use more than one acre\nas curtilage.\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025         Page 7 of 11\n\f   B. The Assessor argues the framers and ratifiers of Article\n      10, Section 1 understood the one-percent tax cap could\n      be limited to one acre.\n   To amend the Indiana Constitution, the General Assembly must pass\nthe same resolution in two consecutive legislative sessions separated by\nan intervening general election. Ind. Const. art. 16, § 1(a); I.C. § 2-2.1-1-1(2)\n(2024). The proposed amendment is then submitted to the voters at the\nnext general election who can then ratify the amendment with a majority\nvote. Ind. Const. art. 16, §§ 1(b), (c). The Assessor argues that the framers\nand ratifiers understood Article 10, Section 1 as codifying the existing\nstatutory tax cap on the “homestead,” including its one-acre size limit,\ninto the Constitution.\n\n  In 2008, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 1 to\namend the Indiana Constitution with the current language of Article 10,\nSection 1(f). The digest of the resolution said the amendment would limit\na taxpayer’s property-tax liability on “homestead property” to one\npercent. Digest of S.J. Res. 1, 115th Gen. Assemb., 2nd Reg. Sess. (Ind.\n2008), http://bit.ly/4nONrG0 [https://perma.cc/2UDB-CQMW]. Almost\nsimultaneously, the General Assembly enacted Indiana Code section 6-1.1-\n20.6-7.5(a)(1) (effective Jan. 1, 2009) which capped a person’s property-tax\nliability for the “homestead” at one percent. See Pub. L. No. 146-2008, §\n223, 2008 Ind. Acts 2307, 2538. In the statute, the General Assembly\ndefined “homestead” as an individual’s principal place of residence\nconsisting of “a dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that\nimmediately surrounds that dwelling.” Id. § 115, 2008 Ind. Acts at 2414\n(emphasis added). In 2010, the next General Assembly adopted the same\nresolution from 2008 to amend the constitution. The 2010 resolution’s\ndigest also said the amendment would cap property taxes at one percent\nfor the “homestead.” See Digest of H.J. Res. 1, 116th Gen. Assemb., 2d Reg.\nSess. (Ind. 2010), http://bit.ly/3KEbjOe [https://perma.cc/Y8SF-WP64].\nAfter the resolution was passed through two consecutive General\nAssemblies, the amendment was ratified by voters in the 2010 general\nelection. But when voting to ratify the amendments, voters never saw the\nword “curtilage.” Instead, the public question on the ballot asked voters if\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025          Page 8 of 11\n\fproperty taxes should be limited to “1% for an owner-occupied primary\nresidence (homestead).” Pub. L. No. 113-2010, § 185, 2010 Ind. Acts. 1342,\n1554 (emphasis added).\n\n   According to the Assessor, the word “homestead” in the public\nquestion and the near simultaneous enactment of the statutory tax cap and\nresolution mean voters understood the amendment as codifying the\nstatutory tax cap, including the one-acre limit, into the Constitution. See\nEric Bradner, Property Tax Caps Decision Now Officially Up to Voters,\nEvansville Courier & Press (Jan. 19, 2010, at 11:06 a.m.),\nhttp://bit.ly/4nHROCS [https://perma.cc/D5EF-UU63] (“The\n[constitutional] caps would limit property tax bills to 1 percent of assessed\nvalue for homeowners. … Those caps became state law in 2008, but\nlawmakers also sought to make them permanent by amending them into\nthe constitution as well.”). And given that it is reasonable to interpret the\nHomestead Statute as constitutional, the Assessor contends the statute\nshould be upheld. See State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs, 702 N.E.2d at 1037.\n\n\n   C. Even if “curtilage” has no size limit, the Taxpayers fail\n      to prove they use more than one acre as curtilage.\n   But we need not decide if Article 10, Section 1 permits limiting\n“curtilage” to one acre because, even if a size limit is impermissible,\nTaxpayers fail to show they use more than one acre as curtilage. “The\nparty challenging the constitutionality of [a] statute bears the burden of\nproof,” and Taxpayers failed to meet their burden of proving the\nHomestead Statute’s one-acre limit is unconstitutional as applied to them.\nSee State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs, 702 N.E.2d at 1037. The Taxpayers offered\nDunn as an example of one way to determine curtilage, but even applying\nthe Dunn factors, they failed to show how their excess land is curtilage.\nThe Taxpayers say they desire privacy, but there is no fence on the\nproperty, the trees do not form a distinguishable boundary around the lot,\nand the Taxpayers presented no evidence to the Board that they use the\nentire plot in such a way that it should be treated as the home itself. And\nthe fact that the Taxpayers’ home is in a gated community with a security\nguard does not itself establish that the entire plot of land is curtilage. See\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025        Page 9 of 11\n\fUnited States v. Powell, 943 F. Supp. 2d 759, 786 (E.D. Mich. 2013)\n(analyzing whether an area is curtilage even within a gated community).\nBecause Taxpayers presented insufficient evidence that they use more\nthan one acre as curtilage, even under Dunn, Taxpayers failed to meet\ntheir burden of proving the Homestead Statute’s one-acre limit is\nunconstitutional as applied to them.\n\n\nConclusion\n    Those challenging the constitutionality of a statute face a high burden\nof proof, and the Taxpayers failed to meet their burden here. Even if\nArticle 10, Section 1 does not permit limiting curtilage to one acre,\nTaxpayers failed to prove they use more than one acre of their property as\ncurtilage, so we express no view on the merits of Taxpayers’ constitutional\nclaim. Because the Taxpayers failed to prove the Homestead Statute is\nunconstitutional as applied to them, we reverse the Tax Court’s decision\nand remand with instructions to affirm the Board’s determination in favor\nof the Assessor.\n\n\nRush, C.J., and Massa, Slaughter, and Molter, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR PETITIONERS\nGerold L.

McAdam, Judge\n\n\n\n                     Opinion by Justice Goff\nChief Justice Rush and Justices Massa, Slaughter, and Molter concur.\n\fGoff, Justice.\n\n   The Indiana Constitution limits a taxpayer’s property-tax liability to a\ncertain percentage of the property’s gross assessed value depending on\nthe class of property. For “[t]angible property, including curtilage, used as\na principal place of residence,” a taxpayer’s liability “may not exceed one\npercent” of the property’s gross assessed value. 1 In implementing this\nconstitutional tax cap, the Indiana Tax Code effectively limits a\nhomeowner’s property-tax liability for the “homestead” to one percent. 2\nThe Tax Code defines “homestead,” in pertinent part, as the dwelling and\nreal estate, “not exceeding one (1) acre,” immediately surrounding the\ndwelling. 3\n\n   The taxpayers here, owners of a home situated on 3.981 acres of land,\nargue that the one-acre size limit on the “homestead” is unconstitutional\nas applied to them because their curtilage exceeds one acre. We hold that,\neven if a person’s curtilage could extend beyond one acre for tax\npurposes, the taxpayers here failed to show their excess property is\ncurtilage and, thus, they failed to carry the burden of proving their\nconstitutional claim. Accordingly, we reverse the Tax Court’s judgment\nand remand with instructions to affirm the Indiana Board of Tax Review’s\ndetermination in favor of the Lake County Assessor.\n\n\nFacts and Procedural History\n   Tulsi and Kamini Sawlani (the Taxpayers) own a two-story home\nsituated on 3.981 acres of land in Crown Point, Indiana. The home is\nlocated in a gated community with a security guard, and access to the\ncommunity is generally limited to residents and their guests. There is a\nfence surrounding the entire community but no fence on the Taxpayers’\nproperty. The Taxpayers have also retained trees on the property for\n\n\n\n1   Ind.

Code § 6-1.1-20</span><pre class=\"inline\">.6-7.5(a)(1) (2019).\n3   I.C. § 6-1.1-12-37(k)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025       Page 2 of 11\n\fprivacy and to limit visibility from a neighboring subdivision, but the\ntrees do not form distinguishing boundaries around the entire lot. The\nTaxpayers desire privacy and say they use the entire parcel to maintain\nprivacy. For the 2019 tax assessment, the Lake County Assessor (or just\nAssessor) classified one acre as the “homestead” and applied a standard\ndeduction and supplemental credit, effectively taxing one acre at one\npercent of the gross assessed value of the property. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ind. Code § 6-1.1</span><pre class=\"inline\">-\n20.6-7.5(a)(1) (2019); I.C. § 6-1.1-12-37(k). But the Assessor classified the\nother 2.981 acres as non-residential property and applied a three-percent\ntax. See I.C. § 6-1.1-20.6-7.5(a)(5).\n\n   The Taxpayers petitioned the assessment to the Lake County Property\nTax Assessment Board of Appeals (the County Board). Though not\ndisputing the total assessed value of their property, the Taxpayers argued\nthat the one-acre size limit under code section 6-1.1-12-37(k) (or the\nHomestead Statute) violates Article 10, Section 1 of the Indiana\nConstitution. In their view, the additional 2.981 acres of property is\ncurtilage and is therefore also entitled to the one-percent tax cap under\nArticle 10, Section 1, making the Homestead Statute unconstitutional as\napplied to them. The County Board rejected Taxpayers’ claims, and the\nIndiana Board of Tax Review (the Board) affirmed. Though\nacknowledging that Taxpayers “may be correct that their 2.981 acres of\nexcess residential acreage could be considered ‘curtilage,’” the Board\nconcluded that it has no authority to declare a statute unconstitutional and\nis bound by the one-acre size limit in the Homestead Statute. App. Vol. 2,\np. 47. Taxpayers appealed to the Tax Court.\n\n  In a for-publication opinion, the Tax Court reversed the Board’s\ndetermination, concluding that “the Constitution does not permit a fixed\none-acre limitation on the amount of land eligible for the one percent tax\ncap.” Sawlani v. Lake Cnty. Assessor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">240 N.E.3d 734</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2024).\nThe Tax Court reasoned that, because Article 10, Section 1 imposes no size\nlimit on a property’s “curtilage,” the Homestead Statute’s one-acre limit\ncould be unconstitutional as applied to some homeowners who own more\nthan one acre. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 750–51. The Tax Court endorsed a “case-by-case\nevaluation” whereby taxpayers with more than one acre of land may\nappeal their assessments to determine whether the excess acreage\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025        Page 3 of 11\n\fqualifies as part of that taxpayer’s curtilage. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 751</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Because the Board\n“did not make sufficient factual findings” to determine whether the\nstatute is unconstitutional as applied to Taxpayers, the Tax Court\nremanded for further proceedings to determine whether Taxpayers’\nexcess acreage “is used as part of the [Taxpayers’] principal place of\nresidence, consistent with the statutory and constitutional frameworks.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 752</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n   The Assessor sought review with this Court which we now grant\nthrough a separate order.

Ind. Const. art.\n10, §§ 1(c)(4), (f)(1). For “[t]angible property, including curtilage, used as a\nprincipal place of residence,” a taxpayer’s liability “may not exceed one\npercent (1%) of the gross assessed value of the property that is the basis\nfor the determination of property taxes.” Id. (emphasis added). This\nconstitutional tax cap is implemented through the Indiana Code. The\nHomestead Statute defines a homeowner’s “homestead,” in pertinent part,\nas a “dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that\n\n\n\n\n4Because the constitutionality of a state statute was called into question, we notified the State,\nand the Attorney General intervened.

We thank them for their helpful submissions.\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025                         Page 4 of 11\n\fimmediately surrounds that dwelling” and is used as the “principal place\nof residence” of the homeowner. I.C. §§ 6-1.1-12-37(k)(1), (2) (emphasis\nadded). A person is entitled to a credit against their homestead’s property-\ntax liability in the amount by which the property tax exceeds one percent.\nI.C. § 6-1.1-20.6-7.5(a). In other words, property taxes on a homeowner’s\n“homestead” are effectively capped at one percent.\n\n   Taxpayers argue that, because the Constitution caps property taxes at\none percent for tangible property, “including curtilage,” used as a\nprincipal place of residence, and because some taxpayers may use more\nthan one acre of their property as curtilage, the Homestead Statute’s one-\nacre limit is unconstitutional as applied to them and others similarly\nsituated. 5 We ultimately conclude there is no need to determine if Article\n10, Section 1 permits a one-acre limit given that Taxpayers presented\ninsufficient evidence that they use their excess property as “curtilage.” We\ntherefore reverse the Tax Court’s judgment and remand with instructions\nto affirm the Board’s determination in favor of the Assessor.\n\n\nI. Even if “curtilage” has no size limit, the Taxpayers\n   fail to show how the Homestead Statute’s one-acre\n   limit is unconstitutional as applied to them.\n   Statutes are “clothed with the presumption of constitutionality until\nclearly overcome by a contrary showing.” Whistle Stop Inn, Inc. v.

The Taxpayers argue that the plain meaning of\n      “curtilage” has no size limit.\n   To discern the “common understanding” of the framers and ratifiers of\nthe constitutional provision, Taxpayers argue that we should look to the\nplain meaning of “curtilage.” The ordinary definition of “curtilage” is “a\nyard, courtyard, or other piece of ground included within a fence\nsurrounding a dwelling house.” Curtilage, Webster’s Third New Int’l\nDictionary 558 (2002 ed.). “Curtilage” also means “the area around a\nhouse that includes grounds, outbuildings, and fencing intimately\nassociated with domestic life in the house,” and has “no standard limits as\nto square footage or size or nature of what is put on the ground.” Curtilage,\nMellinkoff’s Dictionary of American Legal Usage 145 (1992) (emphasis\nadded). From these definitions, Taxpayers argue that the framers and\nratifiers understood “curtilage” to have no size limit.\n\n  Taxpayers also look at how other jurisdictions describe “curtilage” for\nproperty-tax-assessment purposes. In Bullis School, Inc. v. Appeal Tax Court\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025         Page 6 of 11\n\ffor Montgomery County, the property-tax exemption for farm buildings and\ncurtilage extended to thirty-four acres of a 285-acre farm. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2397911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2397911/bullis-school-inc-v-appeal-tax-court/#42\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Bullis School, Inc. v. Appeal Tax Court\">114 A.2d 41, 42</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Md. 1955). In McTague v. Monroe Township, two acres of a forty-acre\nparcel were exempt as curtilage because the area was reasonably required\nfor the “full enjoyment and occupancy of [the] dwelling.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8906519\"><a href=\"/opinion/8918148/mctague-v-monroe-township/#68\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: McTague v.

And in Solebury Township Board of Supervisors v.\nBucks County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, twenty-five acres of\na 71.68-acre parcel constituted reasonable curtilage. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1966 WL 226518</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1\n(Pa. Commw. Ct. Aug. 29, 1966). Based on this precedent from other\njurisdictions, Taxpayers argue “curtilage” can extend beyond one acre.\n\n   Instead of size, Taxpayers look to the four-factor test in United States v.\nDunn as a way to determine whether an area is curtilage. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9430862\"><a href=\"/opinion/111833/united-states-v-dunn/#301\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Dunn\">480 U.S. 294, 301</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1987). In Dunn, the United States Supreme Court held that the curtilage of\nthe home is protected against warrantless searches under the Fourth\nAmendment because an “individual reasonably may expect that the area\nin question should be treated as the home itself.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9430862\"><a href=\"/opinion/111833/united-states-v-dunn/#300\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v.

Whether an\narea is “curtilage” for purposes of a search depends on (1) the proximity\nof the area to the home, (2) whether the area falls within an enclosure\nsurrounding the home, (3) the nature of the uses to which the area is put,\nand (4) the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation\nby passersby. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9430862\"><a href=\"/opinion/111833/united-states-v-dunn/#301\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Dunn\">Id. at 301</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Therefore, according to Taxpayers, whether an\narea is curtilage generally depends on the use of the property.\n\n   Looking at the plain meaning of “curtilage,” and the application of\n“curtilage” in the tax-assessment and Fourth Amendment contexts,\nTaxpayers argue that curtilage has no fixed size limit. Therefore,\naccording to Taxpayers, the Homestead Statute’s one-acre limit is\nunconstitutional as applied to homeowners who use more than one acre\nas curtilage.\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025         Page 7 of 11\n\f   B. The Assessor argues the framers and ratifiers of Article\n      10, Section 1 understood the one-percent tax cap could\n      be limited to one acre.\n   To amend the Indiana Constitution, the General Assembly must pass\nthe same resolution in two consecutive legislative sessions separated by\nan intervening general election. Ind. Const. art. 16, § 1(a); I.C. § 2-2.1-1-1(2)\n(2024). The proposed amendment is then submitted to the voters at the\nnext general election who can then ratify the amendment with a majority\nvote. Ind. Const. art. 16, §§ 1(b), (c). The Assessor argues that the framers\nand ratifiers understood Article 10, Section 1 as codifying the existing\nstatutory tax cap on the “homestead,” including its one-acre size limit,\ninto the Constitution.\n\n  In 2008, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 1 to\namend the Indiana Constitution with the current language of Article 10,\nSection 1(f). The digest of the resolution said the amendment would limit\na taxpayer’s property-tax liability on “homestead property” to one\npercent. Digest of S.J. Res. 1, 115th Gen. Assemb., 2nd Reg. Sess. (Ind.\n2008), http://bit.ly/4nONrG0 [https://perma.cc/2UDB-CQMW]. Almost\nsimultaneously, the General Assembly enacted Indiana Code section 6-1.1-\n20.6-7.5(a)(1) (effective Jan. 1, 2009) which capped a person’s property-tax\nliability for the “homestead” at one percent. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Pub. L. No. 146-2008, §\n223</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2008 Ind. Acts 2307</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2538. In the statute, the General Assembly\ndefined “homestead” as an individual’s principal place of residence\nconsisting of “a dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that\nimmediately surrounds that dwelling.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> § 115, 2008 Ind. Acts at 2414\n(emphasis added). In 2010, the next General Assembly adopted the same\nresolution from 2008 to amend the constitution. The 2010 resolution’s\ndigest also said the amendment would cap property taxes at one percent\nfor the “homestead.” See Digest of H.J. Res. 1, 116th Gen. Assemb., 2d Reg.\nSess. (Ind. 2010), http://bit.ly/3KEbjOe [https://perma.cc/Y8SF-WP64].\nAfter the resolution was passed through two consecutive General\nAssemblies, the amendment was ratified by voters in the 2010 general\nelection. But when voting to ratify the amendments, voters never saw the\nword “curtilage.” Instead, the public question on the ballot asked voters if\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 25S-TA-269 | October 7, 2025          Page 8 of 11\n\fproperty taxes should be limited to “1% for an owner-occupied primary\nresidence (homestead).” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Pub. L. No. 113-2010, § 185</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2010 Ind. Acts. 1342,\n1554 (emphasis added).\n\n   According to the Assessor, the word “homestead” in the public\nquestion and the near simultaneous enactment of the statutory tax cap and\nresolution mean voters understood the amendment as codifying the\nstatutory tax cap, including the one-acre limit, into the Constitution. See\nEric Bradner, Property Tax Caps Decision Now Officially Up to Voters,\nEvansville Courier &amp; Press (Jan. 19, 2010, at 11:06 a.m.),\nhttp://bit.ly/4nHROCS [https://perma.cc/D5EF-UU63] (“The\n[constitutional] caps would limit property tax bills to 1 percent of assessed\nvalue for homeowners. … Those caps became state law in 2008, but\nlawmakers also sought to make them permanent by amending them into\nthe constitution as well.”). And given that it is reasonable to interpret the\nHomestead Statute as constitutional, the Assessor contends the statute\nshould be upheld.

Even if “curtilage” has no size limit, the Taxpayers fail\n      to prove they use more than one acre as curtilage.\n   But we need not decide if Article 10, Section 1 permits limiting\n“curtilage” to one acre because, even if a size limit is impermissible,\nTaxpayers fail to show they use more than one acre as curtilage. “The\nparty challenging the constitutionality of [a] statute bears the burden of\nproof,” and Taxpayers failed to meet their burden of proving the\nHomestead Statute’s one-acre limit is unconstitutional as applied to them.\nSee State Bd. of Tax Comm’rs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9505703\"><a href=\"/opinion/853967/state-board-of-tax-commissioners-v-town-of-st-john/#1037\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State Board of Tax Commissioners v.

The Taxpayers offered\nDunn as an example of one way to determine curtilage, but even applying\nthe Dunn factors, they failed to show how their excess land is curtilage.\nThe Taxpayers say they desire privacy, but there is no fence on the\nproperty, the trees do not form a distinguishable boundary around the lot,\nand the Taxpayers presented no evidence to the Board that they use the\nentire plot in such a way that it should be treated as the home itself. And\nthe fact that the Taxpayers’ home is in a gated community with a security\nguard does not itself establish that the entire plot of land is curtilage.

Even if\nArticle 10, Section 1 does not permit limiting curtilage to one acre,\nTaxpayers failed to prove they use more than one acre of their property as\ncurtilage, so we express no view on the merits of Taxpayers’ constitutional\nclaim. Because the Taxpayers failed to prove the Homestead Statute is\nunconstitutional as applied to them, we reverse the Tax Court’s decision\nand remand with instructions to affirm the Board’s determination in favor\nof the Assessor.\n\n\nRush, C.J., and Massa, Slaughter, and Molter, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR PETITIONERS\nGerold L.

He challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that the murder was committed\nfor the benefit of a criminal street gang; the trial court’s exclusion of certain proffered\ndefense evidence; the constitutionality of his life sentence; and the imposition of a parole\nrevocation fine. For the reasons we will explain, we will affirm the judgment.\n                                 I.    TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS\n         Defendant was charged with murdering German Carrillo in 2019, when both\ndefendant and Carrillo were incarcerated at the Santa Cruz County jail. The murder was\nalleged to have been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, and defendant\nwas charged in a second count with active participation in a criminal street gang.\n    A. GANG EVIDENCE\n         A gang expert testified about the history and structure of Nuestra Familia, a prison\ngang that oversees and collects taxes from Norteño street gangs. According to the expert,\n\fNuestra Familia is characterized by a “militant organizational” structure under which\nthree “generals” exercise control over the gang’s members. Nuestra Familia gang\nmembers are divided into three hierarchical categories: “Cat 1, 2, and 3.” A new member\nwould begin as an “apprentice” in Cat 1 and could work up to Cat 3, which serves as a\ncouncil or “government body” that assists the three generals in making decisions for the\ngang. Nuestra Familia members communicate with each other and with Norteño street\ngang members using “kites,” which are very “small hand written notes” that can be\nsmuggled, commonly in a body cavity, within or out of jails and prisons.\n       The expert testified that in 2019, Norteño gang members incarcerated at the Santa\nCruz County jail were housed in certain units including the maximum-security N unit.\nNorteño inmates kept the unit clean and organized, and enforced strict rules in keeping\nwith the “14 bonds” that all Norteños were expected to follow. The 14 bonds prohibit\nassaulting fellow Norteños (unless the assault is “preapproved” by gang leadership), as\nwell as “snitching” or becoming an informant. When correctional officers entered the\nunit, the inmates would stop what they were doing and remain quiet until the officers left.\nA designated inmate would speak to correctional staff on behalf of the entire unit. For\nsafety, correctional officers commonly worked in pairs rather than alone when\nperforming tasks inside the N unit.\n       According to the expert, three cells in the N unit were known as “Cadillac” cells\nbecause they were large enough to house three inmates. Three other cells were\nconsidered more desirable by inmates because they were obstructed by concrete pillars,\nproviding more privacy. Although inmates were assigned to certain cells by jail\npersonnel, they sometimes changed cells without authorization, and jail personnel would\nsometimes simply note the changes without attempting to undo them. The three Cadillac\ncells often housed “new arrivals” or Norteños under investigation by the gang for\nsuspected violations of gang rules; the three more private cells often housed Norteño\nauthority figures.\n                                             2\n\f       A former Norteño gang member testified that punishment for violating gang rules\ncould range from “writing an essay” to being killed. Senior Norteños would generally be\npunished more harshly than younger gang members. Serious violations (like violent\nattacks on fellow Norteños) could cause the offenders to be “deemed” or “get a green\nlight on them,” which would allow other members to attack and kill them with impunity.\nThe gang has a system for enforcing its rules in the jail. Norteños suspected of violating\nthe gang’s rules “get put on freeze” while the allegations are investigated. The “frozen”\nmember is followed by two “security blankets” who monitor his movements and ensure\nthat he does not try to hurt anyone or leave the unit. The security blankets are expected\nto stab the individual if he makes any sudden movements. If the allegations are\nsubstantiated, he might be subject to “removal” from the unit. A removal involves a\nviolent attack on the inmate found to have violated gang rules, resulting in either the\nperson’s death or transfer to a different unit of the jail. Removals are almost always\ncarried out by multiple members, including two armed with sharp instruments. The\nwitness testified that he had participated in a removal at a jail in Watsonville in March\n2019 against a member accused of stealing drugs from fellow Norteños and selling them\nto other inmates. Shortly after the person was identified for removal, he was attacked by\na team of two armed “strikers” and two “bombers” who provided backup. The intent of\nthe attack was to kill the person, but the strikers’ weapons were ineffective and the victim\nsurvived.\n       Another former Norteño testified that he had been the victim of a removal at the\nSanta Cruz County jail in July 2019. After learning that he had been accused of robbing\nsomeone associated with a high-ranking Nuestra Familia member, he unsuccessfully\nattempted to clear his name. One day, after fellow Norteño inmates made him exercise\nuntil his arms were exhausted, he began showering and was attacked by a group of fellow\nNorteños and stabbed in the chest. He fought back and escaped from the shower, at\nwhich point his attackers told him to push a panic button and “get the fuck out” of the\n                                             3\n\fNorteño unit. One of his attackers also told him the attack was “nothing against you,\nhomie, it’s all business.”\n   B. THE DEATH OF GERMAN CARRILLO\n       In October 2019, defendant was sharing one of the N unit’s Cadillac cells with\nGerman Carrillo and Mario Lozano. (The jail’s official roster indicated that another\ninmate was assigned to that cell instead of defendant, but defendant had taken his place\nwithout permission from jail staff.) On October 12, a correctional officer noticed a pen\n“stuck on the locking mechanism” of the cell door and removed it. All three inmates\nwere seen awake inside the cell that night.\n       At dinnertime on October 13, a correctional officer saw defendant and Lozano in\nthe cell. Carrillo appeared to be sitting on his bunk with his back facing the cell door,\nand he did not turn around or say anything. Lozano was awake when correctional staff\ndelivered breakfast to the cell on the morning of October 14; defendant and Carrillo\nappeared to be asleep in their beds.\n       After 7:00 a.m. on October 14, correctional officers began letting the N unit\ninmates out of their cells on a staggered basis. The officers attempted to let defendant\nand his cellmates out first, but inmates in other cells protested that they were scheduled to\nbe let out first. At 9:46 a.m., an officer saw defendant (who “wasn’t supposed to be out\nof his cell”) “running up the stairs” to his cell and closing the door. Later that morning, a\ncorrectional officer noticed that Carrillo appeared to still be in bed which was unusual\nbecause the Norteño inmates in the unit typically woke up early. The officer asked\nLozano if Carrillo was “okay,” and Lozano shrugged. Two officers entered the cell and\nfound Carrillo’s body wrapped in a blanket. Carrillo’s body was cold to the touch and\nunrecognizable. He appeared to have been beaten and there were “strangle marks around\nhis neck and a few stab wounds.” An autopsy later revealed that Carrillo had likely died\nfrom “ligature strangulation” sometime on October 13.\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       Correctional staff removed inmates from the unit and “lock[ed] down” several\nneighboring units. During that process, a Norteño inmate in another unit asked a\ncorrectional officer “what was going on, did they get the homie over in N unit.” Another\ninmate from the N unit was at a nearby hospital, where he was receiving treatment under\nthe supervision of a sheriff’s deputy. When the inmate learned “N unit was placed on\nlockdown,” he said, “Carrillo, I saw that coming.”\n       Investigators searched the cell and found “a pen tip in the toilet bowl”; a piece of\n“fabric covering the door window”; and a piece of plastic “in the door latch of the cell.”\nThe toilet was clogged and overflowed on October 15. A plumber investigated the\nsource of the blockage, removing a white bedsheet and a “piece of brown towel” from the\npipes. No weapons were found. Investigators did not see any defensive wounds on\ndefendant or Lozano, although photographs showed a “scab” on Lozano’s thumb and\n“redness” around his knees.\n       Surveillance video showed Carrillo being followed around the unit by other\ninmates on October 11 and 12. No one other than defendant, Carrillo, and Lozano could\nbe seen entering or leaving their cell on the night of October 12. Carrillo did not appear\nin any video footage from October 13 or 14. He was often left alone in the cell on those\ndays with the door open and unguarded, whereas someone had always been near him on\nthe previous two days. Defendant and Lozano could be seen moving in and out of the\ncell, as well as sweeping and mopping.\n       Four years later in September 2023, in a search of defendant’s cell correctional\nofficers found kites dating back to 2019. The kites indicated Carrillo had been\ninvestigated by gang authorities for using other inmates’ accounts to make phone calls.\nIn August and September 2019, after having initially denied the allegations, Carrillo paid\nback some money he admitted taking from other inmates’ accounts. He was “placed on\nfreeze” in September and “deemed” on October 10. On October 9, an encrypted message\n\n\n                                             5\n\fwas sent from the jail asking the recipient to deposit $100 into accounts belonging to\ndefendant and Lozano; no such deposits appeared to have been made.\n       A detective determined from reviewing jail phone records and listening to\nrecorded calls that Carrillo had used other inmates’ accounts to call his sister and\ngirlfriend on numerous occasions. A gang expert opined that Carrillo was killed for\nusing his power and authority to steal from fellow Norteños, then lying about it during\nthe gang’s investigation. The expert also opined that in a hypothetical scenario based on\nthe facts of the case, a removal would be carried out by at least two participants in order\nto ensure the attackers’ safety. The hypothetical removal would benefit the gang by\n“inflicting the punishment on somebody that held a position of authority”; “weeding out\nthe weak”; and bolstering the gang’s reputation.\n   C. DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n          1. Defendant’s Testimony\n       Defendant testified that he had joined a Norteño street gang when he was about 12\nyears old and committed numerous gang-related offenses as a minor and young adult. He\nhad been to prison twice and held several positions of authority within the gang during\nhis second prison term. He had twice “been in trouble with the gang” while in prison but\nhad resolved those situations by participating as a bomber in a nonfatal removal and\npaying a $1,000 fine.\n       Defendant and Carrillo were from the same neighborhood and were friendly with\none another, but defendant had only briefly met Lozano before being housed in the N unit\nin 2019. Upon arriving in the unit, defendant was initially assigned to a different cell\nwith different cellmates. In August or September 2019, another inmate asked defendant\nwhether he would be willing to participate in a possible removal. Defendant agreed after\nbeing told the removal “probably wasn’t going to happen.” He did not know that Carrillo\nwas the target or that Carrillo had been stealing money from other inmates.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      About three weeks later, a high-ranking gang member told defendant he was being\ntransferred to the Cadillac cell with Carrillo and Lozano in case the removal went\nforward. Defendant initially resisted the move but complied after being told it was an\norder. At that time, defendant knew Carrillo was “on freeze” but did not know the\nreason. Defendant and Lozano took turns monitoring Carrillo for about two weeks.\n      According to defendant, he woke up between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. on October 13\nand then went back to sleep. When he woke up again, he saw Lozano “strangling”\nCarrillo. Carrillo “didn’t seem like he was putting up much of a fight.” There was a\n“shank” on the floor and Lozano told defendant to flush it down the toilet, which he did.\nAfter Lozano finished killing Carrillo, defendant helped him put Carrillo’s body on the\nbed and clean up the cell. Defendant claimed he had not expected Lozano to kill Carrillo\nand they had not discussed any plan to do so. He explained his demeanor at the time\nCarrillo’s body was discovered (which one correctional officer had described as\n“nonchalant”) by saying that he was trying to “survive” and did not want to show\n“weakness.”\n      After the murder, defendant was transferred to several other units and spent time\nin segregated confinement. Lozano remained in the Norteño unit. Defendant was\nworried that his fellow Norteños might suspect him of “providing information to law\nenforcement” because of his transfer away from the unit, and that they might consider\nhim a “coward” because he had not physically aided Lozano in the attack on Carrillo. He\n“reached out to a good influential friend within the organization” and received a response\nindicating that he was “all good” and would be “coming home soon.” Months after the\nmurder, he was returned to a Norteño unit and assumed a position of authority.\n      In June 2020, defendant learned why Carrillo had been killed. Defendant “felt\nangry” and was “in disbelief that an individual in charge would make such a call for such\na petty offense.” He left the gang about a month later. At some point, he met with the\nprosecution and provided information about the murder.\n                                            7\n\f          2. Other Defense Witnesses\n       A sheriff’s deputy testified that defendant had been interviewed by the prosecution\nin August and November 2020. Although such interviews were typically recorded and\nthe recordings stored in an evidence database, no recording of the August interview was\npresent in the database.\n       A defense attorney testified as an expert in criminal law that, at the time of the\nmurder, defendant was facing unrelated gun charges carrying a maximum sentence of\nnine years and four months in prison. In the attorney’s opinion, defendant’s likely\nsentence in that case would have been four years in prison.\n       A former juvenile correctional officer testified that defendant had twice\nparticipated in his “honor program” as a minor. (The program served as an alternative to\nplacement in juvenile hall.) During defendant’s second time in the program when he was\nprobably 16 or 17 years old, the officer was seriously injured when he fell onto a floor\ncoated with a strong chemical agent. Defendant picked him up and carried him to safety.\nThe officer credited defendant with saving his life.\n       A former police officer testified that he had detained Carrillo in connection with a\nhomicide investigation in 2013, when Carrillo was a minor. The officer secretly recorded\na conversation Carrillo had with another suspect in the back of a police car. According to\na transcript of the recording, Carrillo said, “I didn’t get to break my phone or\nanything. … I could have gotten away with it. I fucked up.”\n       A gang expert testified that rank-and-file gang members would likely know if\nsomeone was “on freeze” but would be unlikely to know the reason for the freeze. He\nopined that in a hypothetical scenario parallelling defendant’s account of Carrillo’s death,\nthe gang member who witnessed the murder could face consequences for failing to\nparticipate and could seek assistance from high-ranking gang members he knew.\n       A criminalist testified that a DNA sample taken from one of Carrillo’s fingernails\ncontained a mixture of DNA from Carrillo and one other person. She calculated it was\n                                              8\n\fabout eight times more likely that the DNA mixture came from Carrillo and a random\nindividual than from Carrillo and defendant. It was five times more likely to have come\nfrom Carrillo and a randomly selected person than from Carrillo and Lozano.\n          3. Excluded Evidence\n       Defendant sought to rebut the prosecution’s evidence regarding his “nonchalant”\ndemeanor following the correctional officers’ discovery of Carrillo’s body. Defense\ncounsel proffered to the trial court that defendant “is being treated for depression” and\nhad “made a suicide attempt,” and that his history of depression would explain his affect\nat the scene. The court ruled the suicide attempt was not relevant, but defendant “can say\nI was depressed and that’s why [I] looked like that.”\n       The trial court sustained the prosecutor’s objections when defense counsel\nattempted to ask defendant whether he was “being treated for any mental health issues”\nor “taking medication” at the time of trial. When counsel later raised the issue outside\nthe jury’s presence, the court confirmed that defendant could say he was “depressed” but\ncould not “talk about his psychiatric diagnosis.”\n   D. VERDICT AND SENTENCING\n       The jury found defendant guilty as charged and found the gang allegations true.\nThe trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison without the possibility of parole for\nspecial circumstance murder, consecutive to a 10-year gang enhancement, and imposed a\nconcurrent determinate sentence of two years in prison on count 2. The court-imposed\nfines and fees including a $5,000 parole revocation fine that was suspended unless and\nuntil parole was revoked.\n                                    II.   DISCUSSION\n   A. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE JURY’S GANG FINDINGS\n       Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support a true finding on\nthe gang special circumstance allegation because the prosecution failed to prove the two\npredicate offenses provided a non-reputational benefit to a criminal street gang. As the\n                                              9\n\fAttorney General observes, defendant’s argument applies with equal force to the special\ngang allegation attached to count 1 and the substantive gang offense charged in count 2.\nWe consider and reject the argument with respect to all three uses.\n       Defendant’s 2024 trial followed the enactment of Assembly Bill No. 333 (2021–\n2022 Reg. Sess.), which amended Penal Code section 186.22 to modify the elemental\ndefinitions of “ ‘pattern of criminal gang activity’ ” and “ ‘criminal street gang’ ” (Pen.\nCode, § 186.22, subds. (e), (f)), and to clarify what it means to “benefit, promote, further,\nor assist” a criminal street gang (Pen. Code, § 186.22, subd. (g); unspecified statutory\nreferences are to the Penal Code). (Stats. 2021, ch. 699, §§ 3, 4.) As relevant here, the\namended statute requires that the predicate offenses must have commonly benefited a\ncriminal street gang and the common benefit must have been more than reputational.\n(§ 186.22, subds. (e)–(g).) Qualifying benefits “may include, but are not limited to,\nfinancial gain or motivation, retaliation, targeting a perceived or actual gang rival, or\nintimidation or silencing of a potential current or previous witness or informant.”\n(§ 186.22, subd. (g).) Given that the jury was properly instructed on the elements of the\nnew law, we review its findings only for substantial evidence. (People v. Shively (2025)\n111 Cal.App.5th 460, 468 (Shively).) Under that standard, “we review the entire record\nin the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nfind the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” (People v. Bolin (1998)\n18 Cal.4th 297, 331.) “We must presume in support of the judgment the existence of\nevery fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence.” (People v.\nMedina (2009) 46 Cal.4th 913, 919.) To overturn the jury’s finding, “it must clearly\nappear that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to\nsupport it.” (People v. Redmond (1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755.)\n       We note that published authorities applying the ameliorative amendments to\nsection 186.22 retroactively are of limited utility here. Although some of those\n                                              10\n\fauthorities have reversed gang findings because the evidence could rationally have shown\nthe predicate offenses provided only reputational benefit (see, e.g., People v. Cooper\n(2023) 14 Cal.5th 735, 739), the “sufficiency of the evidence review applicable in those\ncases is different from that which applies here, where the jury was instructed on the\namended version of section 186.22.” (Shively, supra, 1 11 Cal.App.5th at p. 468.) Both\npredicate offenses in this case involved assaults committed against gang members as\npunishment for perceived violations of gang rules. Defendant contends any benefit\nderived from those assaults was purely reputational, implying that the purpose of\npunishment is inherently reputational in nature. He does not explain how intra-gang\npunishment differs in that respect from “retaliation” or “targeting a perceived or actual\ngang rival,” both of which are listed in the amended statute as benefits that may be\nconsidered “more than reputational” (and both of which involve violence against those\nwhose actions or affiliations put them in conflict with the gang’s perceived interests).\n(§ 186.22, subd. (g).) Nor does he distinguish offenses involving “financial gain or\nmotivation,” which is also listed in section 186.22, subdivision (g) as a potentially\nqualifying common benefit, from offenses committed to punish gang members\nspecifically for perceived financial transgressions against the gang. (There is evidence\nthat the victims of the predicate offenses were suspected of robbing or stealing from gang\nmembers or their associates.)\n       Defendant’s argument relies primarily on People v. Lamb (2024) 16 Cal.5th 400\n(Lamb). In Lamb, “although there was an abundance of gang evidence presented to the\njury, and each predicate offense had a gang enhancement under a prior version of\nsection 186.22, the record [did] not sufficiently disclose the circumstances surrounding\nthe predicate offenses or how any specific predicate offense actually benefited the gang”\nto preclude the possibility that “a rational juror could have reasonably concluded that any\ncommon benefit was not more than reputational.” (Id. at p. 445.) A gang expert\n“testified to his general belief that any crime committed by a gang member benefits the\n                                             11\n\fgang” but “did not expound upon what crimes would benefit the gang, or how.” (Id. at\np. 450.) He “provided some more specific explanations as to how various crimes\nbenefited the gang,” but did so only through general testimony about certain hypothetical\nscenarios, and “the lack of evidence of the circumstances surrounding the predicate\noffenses at issue [did] not establish that they fit into any of those scenarios so as to\npreclude a jury from reasonably concluding that any common benefit was not more than\nreputational.” (Id. at p. 451.) The expert also “repeatedly testified as to how an\nindividual gang member could increase their status and respect within the gang”—from\nwhich “a juror could have concluded that the predicate offenses were committed to\nbolster the offender’s reputation within the gang, or if committed alongside other gang\nmembers, that the offense provided the common benefit of increased status to each\nperpetrator.” (Id. at p. 453.)\n       Despite those deficiencies, our Supreme Court suggested the evidence in Lamb\nmay have been sufficient to establish a non-reputational benefit had the case been tried\nfollowing the enactment of Assembly Bill No. 333 and the jury instructed on the\nelements of the amended statute. (See Lamb, supra, 16 Cal.5th at pp. 453 [“a rational\njuror may well infer that at least two of the predicate offenses were committed for a\ncommon benefit that was more than reputational”], 455 [“Were this a question of\nsufficiency of the evidence, the outcome might be different”].) The Supreme Court\nnonetheless reversed the gang findings because it could not conclude beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the jury would have found the predicate offenses provided a qualifying benefit,\nhad the jury been asked to do so. (Id. at pp. 448–449, 454–455.) But as we have\ndiscussed, the jury in this case did make that finding, and our review is limited to whether\nits finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n       The evidence here is also stronger in some respects than the evidence in Lamb.\nUnlike in Lamb, there is case-specific evidence establishing the circumstances of the\npredicate offenses. There is also evidence that both predicate offenses fall within a\n                                              12\n\fcategory of offenses (i.e., removals) from which a jury could reasonably infer that the\noffenses themselves benefited the gang. From the evidence presented here, a jury could\nrationally conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that both predicate offenses provided a\ncommon benefit to the gang that was more than reputational. Sufficient evidence\ntherefore supports the jury’s true findings on the special circumstance and special gang\nallegations attached to count 1, as well as the guilty verdict on count 2.\n   B. THE EXCLUSION OF MARGINAL EVIDENCE DOES NOT REQUIRE REVERSAL\n       Defendant argues he was deprived of due process by the trial court’s exclusion of\ncertain proffered evidence relating to his mental health, which he asserts prevented him\nfrom rebutting the prosecution’s evidence that he appeared nonchalant when Carrillo’s\nbody was found in his cell. We see no due process violation or reversible error in the\ncourt’s exclusion of the evidence.\n       “As a general matter, the ‘[a]pplication of the ordinary rules of evidence … does\nnot impermissibly infringe on a defendant’s right to present a defense.’ ” (People v.\nFudge (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1102–1103.) “Although completely excluding evidence of\nan accused’s defense theoretically could rise to this level, excluding defense evidence on\na minor or subsidiary point does not impair an accused’s due process right to present a\ndefense.” (Id. at p. 1103.) Under state law, “only relevant evidence is admissible” and\ntrial courts are vested with broad discretion to determine relevance. (People v. Kelly\n(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 523.) “The court’s ruling will not be disturbed unless made ‘in an\narbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of\njustice.’ ” (People v. Powell (2018) 6 Cal.5th 136, 162.) A “ ‘miscarriage of justice’\nshould be declared only when the court, ‘after an examination of the entire cause,\nincluding the evidence,’ is of the ‘opinion’ that it is reasonably probable that a result\nmore favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the\nerror.” (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) Where a court’s exclusion of\ndefense evidence is erroneous under state law but does not deprive a defendant of his\n                                              13\n\fconstitutional right to present a defense, prejudice is assessed under the Watson standard.\n(Fudge, at p. 1103.)\n       The trial court’s exclusion of defendant’s proffered evidence did not deprive him\nof the right to present a defense. The limited testimony about defendant’s demeanor was\nnot central to the prosecution’s case, and defendant took the opportunity to address that\nevidence when he testified that he was trying to “survive” and did not want to show\n“weakness.” The court also ruled that defendant could testify he was “depressed” at the\ntime, although defendant elected not to mention depression in testifying about his\ndemeanor. As defendant was given an opportunity to explain his demeanor, and the\nexplanation he provided did not directly relate to his mental health, additional evidence\nconcerning the specific nature of any mental health issues was not essential to his\ndefense. Some of the excluded evidence was also of questionable relevance, at least with\nrespect to the grounds offered for its admission. Evidence that defendant was taking\nmedication and being treated for depression at the time of his 2024 trial, and had\nattempted suicide sometime before trial, would provide limited insight into why he\nappeared nonchalant years earlier when Carrillo’s death was discovered in 2019. 1 (Cf.\nPeople v. Gana (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 598, 612.) On this record, we cannot say the\ntrial court abused its discretion in excluding that evidence.\n       We acknowledge the possibility that the trial court’s ruling may have resulted in\nthe exclusion of other, relevant evidence. In discussing the scope of permissible\ntestimony about defendant’s past and current mental condition (including medications he\nwas then receiving at the jail), defense counsel emphasized that defendant had “been\ntreated for depression since he was a child.” The court reiterated that defendant could say\nhe was “depressed” in 2019 but could not “talk about his psychiatric diagnosis.” The\n\n\n       1\n         Although the relevant portions of the record do not indicate when defendant’s\nsuicide attempt occurred, other information in the record suggests it may have taken place\nin 2023.\n                                             14\n\fcourt had sustained an objection to counsel’s attempt to question defendant about his\nmental condition at the time of trial, and the court also precluded defendant’s testimony\nabout a depressive diagnosis, even if that diagnosis preceded the charged murder. But\neven assuming the scope of the court’s ruling resulted in the erroneous exclusion of\nevidence relating to defendant’s mental health in 2019, we see no reasonable probability\nof a different result had such evidence been admitted. Defendant’s demeanor\nimmediately following Carrillo’s death was a marginal issue, defendant provided an\nexplanation for his demeanor that did not depend on the excluded evidence, and other\nevidence pointed strongly to defendant’s direct involvement in the murder. Any possible\nerror was not prejudicial under the applicable state-law standard.\n   C. DEFENDANT’S SENTENCE IS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY CRUEL OR UNUSUAL\n       Defendant argues his mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole—for a murder committed when he was 25 years old—violates the California\nConstitution’s prohibition on cruel or unusual punishment. The power to define\npunishment for crimes is a legislative function, so we proceed with deference when there\nis a constitutional challenge to the length of a prison term. (People v. Baker (2018)\n20 Cal.App.5th 711, 729.) A punishment is cruel or unusual only if it “is so\ndisproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and\noffends fundamental notions of human dignity.” (In re Lynch (1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 424.)\nRelevant considerations include “(1) the nature of the offense and the nature of the\noffender with regard to the degree of danger both present to society, (2) a comparison of\nthe punishment with the punishments prescribed for more serious crimes in the\njurisdiction, and (3) a comparison of the punishment with punishments for the same\noffense in other jurisdictions.” (People v. Guenther (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 483, 532–\n533, citing In re Lynch, at pp. 425–427.)\n       In support of his constitutional claim, defendant references his “youth, his\nethnicity, and the conditions of the Main Jail in Santa Cruz County,” where the crime\n                                             15\n\foccurred. We recognize defendant was 25 years old at the time of the murder. As he\nacknowledges, the California Supreme Court has found a rational basis for the\nLegislature’s “exclusion of offenders who are serving sentences of life in prison without\nthe possibility of parole for a crime committed after the age of 18 from youth offender\nparole eligibility” under section 3051, subdivision (h). (People v. Hardin (2024)\n15 Cal.5th 834, 864.) Although Hardin involved an equal protection claim, not a claim\nof cruel or unusual punishment, the Supreme Court’s holding undermines defendant’s\nargument that a life sentence for a murder committed at age 25 is so disproportionate in\nlight of youth as to be unconstitutional.\n         Defendant refers to “his ethnicity” and the existence of sentencing disparities\nbased on race or ethnicity, but he does not explain how that renders the sentence\ndisproportionate in this case. Nor does he explain how what he describes as dangerous\nconditions and lax security measures at the jail in 2019 render him less culpable for the\nmurder of a fellow inmate. He offers no comparison between his punishment and the\npunishments prescribed for more serious crimes in the same jurisdiction, or for the same\ncrime in other jurisdictions. Defendant has not met his burden of establishing that his\nsentence is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual.\n   D. IMPOSITION OF A PAROLE REVOCATION FINE\n         The parties both view the parole revocation fine as erroneously imposed given\ndefendant’s sentence on count 1 to life without the possibility of parole. We\nacknowledge the parties’ logic, but we disagree with its application based on Supreme\nCourt precedent and we therefore do not accept the Attorney General’s concession on the\npoint.\n         Section 1202.45, subdivision (a) states: “In every case where a person is\nconvicted of a crime and his or her sentence includes a period of parole, the court shall, at\nthe time of imposing the restitution fine pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.4,\nassess an additional parole revocation restitution fine in the same amount as that imposed\n                                              16\n\fpursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.4.” In addition to the life term and 10-year\nenhancement imposed on count 1, defendant also received a concurrent determinate\nsentence of two years in prison on count 2. His sentence therefore technically “ ‘includes\na period of parole,’ ” however unlikely he is to ever spend time on parole, and a parole\nrevocation fine was statutorily required. (§ 1202.45, subd. (a); People v. Baker (2021)\n10 Cal.5th 1044, 1108–1109.) As the Supreme Court has reasoned, “[d]efendant is in no\nway prejudiced by assessment of the fine, which will become payable only if he actually\ndoes begin serving a period of parole and his parole is revoked.” (People v. Brasure\n(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1037, 1075; see also People v. Alvarez (Aug. 18, 2025, S089619) ___\nCal.5th ___ [reaffirming but distinguishing Brasure where no determinate term was\nimposed].)\n                                   III.

He challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that the murder was committed\nfor the benefit of a criminal street gang; the trial court’s exclusion of certain proffered\ndefense evidence; the constitutionality of his life sentence; and the imposition of a parole\nrevocation fine. For the reasons we will explain, we will affirm the judgment.\n                                 I.    TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS\n         Defendant was charged with murdering German Carrillo in 2019, when both\ndefendant and Carrillo were incarcerated at the Santa Cruz County jail. The murder was\nalleged to have been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, and defendant\nwas charged in a second count with active participation in a criminal street gang.\n    A. GANG EVIDENCE\n         A gang expert testified about the history and structure of Nuestra Familia, a prison\ngang that oversees and collects taxes from Norteño street gangs. According to the expert,\n\fNuestra Familia is characterized by a “militant organizational” structure under which\nthree “generals” exercise control over the gang’s members. Nuestra Familia gang\nmembers are divided into three hierarchical categories: “Cat 1, 2, and 3.” A new member\nwould begin as an “apprentice” in Cat 1 and could work up to Cat 3, which serves as a\ncouncil or “government body” that assists the three generals in making decisions for the\ngang. Nuestra Familia members communicate with each other and with Norteño street\ngang members using “kites,” which are very “small hand written notes” that can be\nsmuggled, commonly in a body cavity, within or out of jails and prisons.\n       The expert testified that in 2019, Norteño gang members incarcerated at the Santa\nCruz County jail were housed in certain units including the maximum-security N unit.\nNorteño inmates kept the unit clean and organized, and enforced strict rules in keeping\nwith the “14 bonds” that all Norteños were expected to follow. The 14 bonds prohibit\nassaulting fellow Norteños (unless the assault is “preapproved” by gang leadership), as\nwell as “snitching” or becoming an informant. When correctional officers entered the\nunit, the inmates would stop what they were doing and remain quiet until the officers left.\nA designated inmate would speak to correctional staff on behalf of the entire unit. For\nsafety, correctional officers commonly worked in pairs rather than alone when\nperforming tasks inside the N unit.\n       According to the expert, three cells in the N unit were known as “Cadillac” cells\nbecause they were large enough to house three inmates. Three other cells were\nconsidered more desirable by inmates because they were obstructed by concrete pillars,\nproviding more privacy. Although inmates were assigned to certain cells by jail\npersonnel, they sometimes changed cells without authorization, and jail personnel would\nsometimes simply note the changes without attempting to undo them. The three Cadillac\ncells often housed “new arrivals” or Norteños under investigation by the gang for\nsuspected violations of gang rules; the three more private cells often housed Norteño\nauthority figures.\n                                             2\n\f       A former Norteño gang member testified that punishment for violating gang rules\ncould range from “writing an essay” to being killed. Senior Norteños would generally be\npunished more harshly than younger gang members. Serious violations (like violent\nattacks on fellow Norteños) could cause the offenders to be “deemed” or “get a green\nlight on them,” which would allow other members to attack and kill them with impunity.\nThe gang has a system for enforcing its rules in the jail. Norteños suspected of violating\nthe gang’s rules “get put on freeze” while the allegations are investigated. The “frozen”\nmember is followed by two “security blankets” who monitor his movements and ensure\nthat he does not try to hurt anyone or leave the unit. The security blankets are expected\nto stab the individual if he makes any sudden movements. If the allegations are\nsubstantiated, he might be subject to “removal” from the unit. A removal involves a\nviolent attack on the inmate found to have violated gang rules, resulting in either the\nperson’s death or transfer to a different unit of the jail. Removals are almost always\ncarried out by multiple members, including two armed with sharp instruments. The\nwitness testified that he had participated in a removal at a jail in Watsonville in March\n2019 against a member accused of stealing drugs from fellow Norteños and selling them\nto other inmates. Shortly after the person was identified for removal, he was attacked by\na team of two armed “strikers” and two “bombers” who provided backup. The intent of\nthe attack was to kill the person, but the strikers’ weapons were ineffective and the victim\nsurvived.\n       Another former Norteño testified that he had been the victim of a removal at the\nSanta Cruz County jail in July 2019. After learning that he had been accused of robbing\nsomeone associated with a high-ranking Nuestra Familia member, he unsuccessfully\nattempted to clear his name. One day, after fellow Norteño inmates made him exercise\nuntil his arms were exhausted, he began showering and was attacked by a group of fellow\nNorteños and stabbed in the chest. He fought back and escaped from the shower, at\nwhich point his attackers told him to push a panic button and “get the fuck out” of the\n                                             3\n\fNorteño unit. One of his attackers also told him the attack was “nothing against you,\nhomie, it’s all business.”\n   B. THE DEATH OF GERMAN CARRILLO\n       In October 2019, defendant was sharing one of the N unit’s Cadillac cells with\nGerman Carrillo and Mario Lozano. (The jail’s official roster indicated that another\ninmate was assigned to that cell instead of defendant, but defendant had taken his place\nwithout permission from jail staff.) On October 12, a correctional officer noticed a pen\n“stuck on the locking mechanism” of the cell door and removed it. All three inmates\nwere seen awake inside the cell that night.\n       At dinnertime on October 13, a correctional officer saw defendant and Lozano in\nthe cell. Carrillo appeared to be sitting on his bunk with his back facing the cell door,\nand he did not turn around or say anything. Lozano was awake when correctional staff\ndelivered breakfast to the cell on the morning of October 14; defendant and Carrillo\nappeared to be asleep in their beds.\n       After 7:00 a.m. on October 14, correctional officers began letting the N unit\ninmates out of their cells on a staggered basis. The officers attempted to let defendant\nand his cellmates out first, but inmates in other cells protested that they were scheduled to\nbe let out first. At 9:46 a.m., an officer saw defendant (who “wasn’t supposed to be out\nof his cell”) “running up the stairs” to his cell and closing the door. Later that morning, a\ncorrectional officer noticed that Carrillo appeared to still be in bed which was unusual\nbecause the Norteño inmates in the unit typically woke up early. The officer asked\nLozano if Carrillo was “okay,” and Lozano shrugged. Two officers entered the cell and\nfound Carrillo’s body wrapped in a blanket. Carrillo’s body was cold to the touch and\nunrecognizable. He appeared to have been beaten and there were “strangle marks around\nhis neck and a few stab wounds.” An autopsy later revealed that Carrillo had likely died\nfrom “ligature strangulation” sometime on October 13.\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       Correctional staff removed inmates from the unit and “lock[ed] down” several\nneighboring units. During that process, a Norteño inmate in another unit asked a\ncorrectional officer “what was going on, did they get the homie over in N unit.” Another\ninmate from the N unit was at a nearby hospital, where he was receiving treatment under\nthe supervision of a sheriff’s deputy. When the inmate learned “N unit was placed on\nlockdown,” he said, “Carrillo, I saw that coming.”\n       Investigators searched the cell and found “a pen tip in the toilet bowl”; a piece of\n“fabric covering the door window”; and a piece of plastic “in the door latch of the cell.”\nThe toilet was clogged and overflowed on October 15. A plumber investigated the\nsource of the blockage, removing a white bedsheet and a “piece of brown towel” from the\npipes. No weapons were found. Investigators did not see any defensive wounds on\ndefendant or Lozano, although photographs showed a “scab” on Lozano’s thumb and\n“redness” around his knees.\n       Surveillance video showed Carrillo being followed around the unit by other\ninmates on October 11 and 12. No one other than defendant, Carrillo, and Lozano could\nbe seen entering or leaving their cell on the night of October 12. Carrillo did not appear\nin any video footage from October 13 or 14. He was often left alone in the cell on those\ndays with the door open and unguarded, whereas someone had always been near him on\nthe previous two days. Defendant and Lozano could be seen moving in and out of the\ncell, as well as sweeping and mopping.\n       Four years later in September 2023, in a search of defendant’s cell correctional\nofficers found kites dating back to 2019. The kites indicated Carrillo had been\ninvestigated by gang authorities for using other inmates’ accounts to make phone calls.\nIn August and September 2019, after having initially denied the allegations, Carrillo paid\nback some money he admitted taking from other inmates’ accounts. He was “placed on\nfreeze” in September and “deemed” on October 10. On October 9, an encrypted message\n\n\n                                             5\n\fwas sent from the jail asking the recipient to deposit $100 into accounts belonging to\ndefendant and Lozano; no such deposits appeared to have been made.\n       A detective determined from reviewing jail phone records and listening to\nrecorded calls that Carrillo had used other inmates’ accounts to call his sister and\ngirlfriend on numerous occasions. A gang expert opined that Carrillo was killed for\nusing his power and authority to steal from fellow Norteños, then lying about it during\nthe gang’s investigation. The expert also opined that in a hypothetical scenario based on\nthe facts of the case, a removal would be carried out by at least two participants in order\nto ensure the attackers’ safety. The hypothetical removal would benefit the gang by\n“inflicting the punishment on somebody that held a position of authority”; “weeding out\nthe weak”; and bolstering the gang’s reputation.\n   C. DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n          1. Defendant’s Testimony\n       Defendant testified that he had joined a Norteño street gang when he was about 12\nyears old and committed numerous gang-related offenses as a minor and young adult. He\nhad been to prison twice and held several positions of authority within the gang during\nhis second prison term. He had twice “been in trouble with the gang” while in prison but\nhad resolved those situations by participating as a bomber in a nonfatal removal and\npaying a $1,000 fine.\n       Defendant and Carrillo were from the same neighborhood and were friendly with\none another, but defendant had only briefly met Lozano before being housed in the N unit\nin 2019. Upon arriving in the unit, defendant was initially assigned to a different cell\nwith different cellmates. In August or September 2019, another inmate asked defendant\nwhether he would be willing to participate in a possible removal. Defendant agreed after\nbeing told the removal “probably wasn’t going to happen.” He did not know that Carrillo\nwas the target or that Carrillo had been stealing money from other inmates.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      About three weeks later, a high-ranking gang member told defendant he was being\ntransferred to the Cadillac cell with Carrillo and Lozano in case the removal went\nforward. Defendant initially resisted the move but complied after being told it was an\norder. At that time, defendant knew Carrillo was “on freeze” but did not know the\nreason. Defendant and Lozano took turns monitoring Carrillo for about two weeks.\n      According to defendant, he woke up between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. on October 13\nand then went back to sleep. When he woke up again, he saw Lozano “strangling”\nCarrillo. Carrillo “didn’t seem like he was putting up much of a fight.” There was a\n“shank” on the floor and Lozano told defendant to flush it down the toilet, which he did.\nAfter Lozano finished killing Carrillo, defendant helped him put Carrillo’s body on the\nbed and clean up the cell. Defendant claimed he had not expected Lozano to kill Carrillo\nand they had not discussed any plan to do so. He explained his demeanor at the time\nCarrillo’s body was discovered (which one correctional officer had described as\n“nonchalant”) by saying that he was trying to “survive” and did not want to show\n“weakness.”\n      After the murder, defendant was transferred to several other units and spent time\nin segregated confinement. Lozano remained in the Norteño unit. Defendant was\nworried that his fellow Norteños might suspect him of “providing information to law\nenforcement” because of his transfer away from the unit, and that they might consider\nhim a “coward” because he had not physically aided Lozano in the attack on Carrillo. He\n“reached out to a good influential friend within the organization” and received a response\nindicating that he was “all good” and would be “coming home soon.” Months after the\nmurder, he was returned to a Norteño unit and assumed a position of authority.\n      In June 2020, defendant learned why Carrillo had been killed. Defendant “felt\nangry” and was “in disbelief that an individual in charge would make such a call for such\na petty offense.” He left the gang about a month later. At some point, he met with the\nprosecution and provided information about the murder.\n                                            7\n\f          2. Other Defense Witnesses\n       A sheriff’s deputy testified that defendant had been interviewed by the prosecution\nin August and November 2020. Although such interviews were typically recorded and\nthe recordings stored in an evidence database, no recording of the August interview was\npresent in the database.\n       A defense attorney testified as an expert in criminal law that, at the time of the\nmurder, defendant was facing unrelated gun charges carrying a maximum sentence of\nnine years and four months in prison. In the attorney’s opinion, defendant’s likely\nsentence in that case would have been four years in prison.\n       A former juvenile correctional officer testified that defendant had twice\nparticipated in his “honor program” as a minor. (The program served as an alternative to\nplacement in juvenile hall.) During defendant’s second time in the program when he was\nprobably 16 or 17 years old, the officer was seriously injured when he fell onto a floor\ncoated with a strong chemical agent. Defendant picked him up and carried him to safety.\nThe officer credited defendant with saving his life.\n       A former police officer testified that he had detained Carrillo in connection with a\nhomicide investigation in 2013, when Carrillo was a minor. The officer secretly recorded\na conversation Carrillo had with another suspect in the back of a police car. According to\na transcript of the recording, Carrillo said, “I didn’t get to break my phone or\nanything. … I could have gotten away with it. I fucked up.”\n       A gang expert testified that rank-and-file gang members would likely know if\nsomeone was “on freeze” but would be unlikely to know the reason for the freeze. He\nopined that in a hypothetical scenario parallelling defendant’s account of Carrillo’s death,\nthe gang member who witnessed the murder could face consequences for failing to\nparticipate and could seek assistance from high-ranking gang members he knew.\n       A criminalist testified that a DNA sample taken from one of Carrillo’s fingernails\ncontained a mixture of DNA from Carrillo and one other person. She calculated it was\n                                              8\n\fabout eight times more likely that the DNA mixture came from Carrillo and a random\nindividual than from Carrillo and defendant. It was five times more likely to have come\nfrom Carrillo and a randomly selected person than from Carrillo and Lozano.\n          3. Excluded Evidence\n       Defendant sought to rebut the prosecution’s evidence regarding his “nonchalant”\ndemeanor following the correctional officers’ discovery of Carrillo’s body. Defense\ncounsel proffered to the trial court that defendant “is being treated for depression” and\nhad “made a suicide attempt,” and that his history of depression would explain his affect\nat the scene. The court ruled the suicide attempt was not relevant, but defendant “can say\nI was depressed and that’s why [I] looked like that.”\n       The trial court sustained the prosecutor’s objections when defense counsel\nattempted to ask defendant whether he was “being treated for any mental health issues”\nor “taking medication” at the time of trial. When counsel later raised the issue outside\nthe jury’s presence, the court confirmed that defendant could say he was “depressed” but\ncould not “talk about his psychiatric diagnosis.”\n   D. VERDICT AND SENTENCING\n       The jury found defendant guilty as charged and found the gang allegations true.\nThe trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison without the possibility of parole for\nspecial circumstance murder, consecutive to a 10-year gang enhancement, and imposed a\nconcurrent determinate sentence of two years in prison on count 2. The court-imposed\nfines and fees including a $5,000 parole revocation fine that was suspended unless and\nuntil parole was revoked.\n                                    II.   DISCUSSION\n   A. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE JURY’S GANG FINDINGS\n       Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support a true finding on\nthe gang special circumstance allegation because the prosecution failed to prove the two\npredicate offenses provided a non-reputational benefit to a criminal street gang. As the\n                                              9\n\fAttorney General observes, defendant’s argument applies with equal force to the special\ngang allegation attached to count 1 and the substantive gang offense charged in count 2.\nWe consider and reject the argument with respect to all three uses.\n       Defendant’s 2024 trial followed the enactment of Assembly Bill No. 333 (2021–\n2022 Reg. Sess.), which amended Penal Code section 186.22 to modify the elemental\ndefinitions of “ ‘pattern of criminal gang activity’ ” and “ ‘criminal street gang’ ” (Pen.\nCode, § 186.22, subds. (e), (f)), and to clarify what it means to “benefit, promote, further,\nor assist” a criminal street gang (Pen. Code, § 186.22, subd. (g); unspecified statutory\nreferences are to the Penal Code). (Stats. 2021, ch. 699, §§ 3, 4.) As relevant here, the\namended statute requires that the predicate offenses must have commonly benefited a\ncriminal street gang and the common benefit must have been more than reputational.\n(§ 186.22, subds. (e)–(g).) Qualifying benefits “may include, but are not limited to,\nfinancial gain or motivation, retaliation, targeting a perceived or actual gang rival, or\nintimidation or silencing of a potential current or previous witness or informant.”\n(§ 186.22, subd. (g).) Given that the jury was properly instructed on the elements of the\nnew law, we review its findings only for substantial evidence. (People v. Shively (2025)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">111 Cal.App.5th 460</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468 (Shively).) Under that standard, “we review the entire record\nin the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nfind the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” (People v. Bolin (1998)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433861\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433861/people-v-bolin/#331\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Bolin\">18 Cal.4th 297, 331</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) “We must presume in support of the judgment the existence of\nevery fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence.” (People v.\nMedina (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9795881\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625773/people-v-medina/#919\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Medina\">46 Cal.4th 913, 919</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) To overturn the jury’s finding, “it must clearly\nappear that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to\nsupport it.” (People v. Redmond (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9546425\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169922/people-v-redmond/#755\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Redmond\">71 Cal.2d 745, 755</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n       We note that published authorities applying the ameliorative amendments to\nsection 186.22 retroactively are of limited utility here. Although some of those\n                                              10\n\fauthorities have reversed gang findings because the evidence could rationally have shown\nthe predicate offenses provided only reputational benefit (see, e.g., People v. Cooper\n(2023) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">14 Cal.5th 735</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739), the “sufficiency of the evidence review applicable in those\ncases is different from that which applies here, where the jury was instructed on the\namended version of section 186.22.” (Shively, supra, 1 11 Cal.App.5th at p. 468.) Both\npredicate offenses in this case involved assaults committed against gang members as\npunishment for perceived violations of gang rules. Defendant contends any benefit\nderived from those assaults was purely reputational, implying that the purpose of\npunishment is inherently reputational in nature. He does not explain how intra-gang\npunishment differs in that respect from “retaliation” or “targeting a perceived or actual\ngang rival,” both of which are listed in the amended statute as benefits that may be\nconsidered “more than reputational” (and both of which involve violence against those\nwhose actions or affiliations put them in conflict with the gang’s perceived interests).\n(§ 186.22, subd. (g).) Nor does he distinguish offenses involving “financial gain or\nmotivation,” which is also listed in section 186.22, subdivision (g) as a potentially\nqualifying common benefit, from offenses committed to punish gang members\nspecifically for perceived financial transgressions against the gang. (There is evidence\nthat the victims of the predicate offenses were suspected of robbing or stealing from gang\nmembers or their associates.)\n       Defendant’s argument relies primarily on People v. Lamb (2024) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.5th 400</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Lamb). In Lamb, “although there was an abundance of gang evidence presented to the\njury, and each predicate offense had a gang enhancement under a prior version of\nsection 186.22, the record [did] not sufficiently disclose the circumstances surrounding\nthe predicate offenses or how any specific predicate offense actually benefited the gang”\nto preclude the possibility that “a rational juror could have reasonably concluded that any\ncommon benefit was not more than reputational.” (Id. at p. 445.) A gang expert\n“testified to his general belief that any crime committed by a gang member benefits the\n                                             11\n\fgang” but “did not expound upon what crimes would benefit the gang, or how.” (Id. at\np. 450.) He “provided some more specific explanations as to how various crimes\nbenefited the gang,” but did so only through general testimony about certain hypothetical\nscenarios, and “the lack of evidence of the circumstances surrounding the predicate\noffenses at issue [did] not establish that they fit into any of those scenarios so as to\npreclude a jury from reasonably concluding that any common benefit was not more than\nreputational.” (Id. at p. 451.) The expert also “repeatedly testified as to how an\nindividual gang member could increase their status and respect within the gang”—from\nwhich “a juror could have concluded that the predicate offenses were committed to\nbolster the offender’s reputation within the gang, or if committed alongside other gang\nmembers, that the offense provided the common benefit of increased status to each\nperpetrator.” (Id. at p. 453.)\n       Despite those deficiencies, our Supreme Court suggested the evidence in Lamb\nmay have been sufficient to establish a non-reputational benefit had the case been tried\nfollowing the enactment of Assembly Bill No. 333 and the jury instructed on the\nelements of the amended statute. (See Lamb, supra, 16 Cal.5th at pp. 453 [“a rational\njuror may well infer that at least two of the predicate offenses were committed for a\ncommon benefit that was more than reputational”], 455 [“Were this a question of\nsufficiency of the evidence, the outcome might be different”].) The Supreme Court\nnonetheless reversed the gang findings because it could not conclude beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the jury would have found the predicate offenses provided a qualifying benefit,\nhad the jury been asked to do so. (Id. at pp. 448–449, 454–455.) But as we have\ndiscussed, the jury in this case did make that finding, and our review is limited to whether\nits finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n       The evidence here is also stronger in some respects than the evidence in Lamb.\nUnlike in Lamb, there is case-specific evidence establishing the circumstances of the\npredicate offenses. There is also evidence that both predicate offenses fall within a\n                                              12\n\fcategory of offenses (i.e., removals) from which a jury could reasonably infer that the\noffenses themselves benefited the gang. From the evidence presented here, a jury could\nrationally conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that both predicate offenses provided a\ncommon benefit to the gang that was more than reputational. Sufficient evidence\ntherefore supports the jury’s true findings on the special circumstance and special gang\nallegations attached to count 1, as well as the guilty verdict on count 2.\n   B. THE EXCLUSION OF MARGINAL EVIDENCE DOES NOT REQUIRE REVERSAL\n       Defendant argues he was deprived of due process by the trial court’s exclusion of\ncertain proffered evidence relating to his mental health, which he asserts prevented him\nfrom rebutting the prosecution’s evidence that he appeared nonchalant when Carrillo’s\nbody was found in his cell. We see no due process violation or reversible error in the\ncourt’s exclusion of the evidence.\n       “As a general matter, the ‘[a]pplication of the ordinary rules of evidence … does\nnot impermissibly infringe on a defendant’s right to present a defense.’ ” (People v.\nFudge (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9792648\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612898/people-v-fudge/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Fudge\">7 Cal.4th 1075</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1102–1103.) “Although completely excluding evidence of\nan accused’s defense theoretically could rise to this level, excluding defense evidence on\na minor or subsidiary point does not impair an accused’s due process right to present a\ndefense.” (Id. at p. 1103.) Under state law, “only relevant evidence is admissible” and\ntrial courts are vested with broad discretion to determine relevance. (People v. Kelly\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119859\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119859/people-v-kelly/#523\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Kelly\">1 Cal.4th 495, 523</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) “The court’s ruling will not be disturbed unless made ‘in an\narbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of\njustice.’ ” (People v. Powell (2018) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">6 Cal.5th 136</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162.) A “ ‘miscarriage of justice’\nshould be declared only when the court, ‘after an examination of the entire cause,\nincluding the evidence,’ is of the ‘opinion’ that it is reasonably probable that a result\nmore favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the\nerror.” (People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9631606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/#836\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Watson\">46 Cal.2d 818, 836</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Where a court’s exclusion of\ndefense evidence is erroneous under state law but does not deprive a defendant of his\n                                              13\n\fconstitutional right to present a defense, prejudice is assessed under the Watson standard.\n(Fudge, at p. 1103.)\n       The trial court’s exclusion of defendant’s proffered evidence did not deprive him\nof the right to present a defense. The limited testimony about defendant’s demeanor was\nnot central to the prosecution’s case, and defendant took the opportunity to address that\nevidence when he testified that he was trying to “survive” and did not want to show\n“weakness.” The court also ruled that defendant could testify he was “depressed” at the\ntime, although defendant elected not to mention depression in testifying about his\ndemeanor. As defendant was given an opportunity to explain his demeanor, and the\nexplanation he provided did not directly relate to his mental health, additional evidence\nconcerning the specific nature of any mental health issues was not essential to his\ndefense. Some of the excluded evidence was also of questionable relevance, at least with\nrespect to the grounds offered for its admission. Evidence that defendant was taking\nmedication and being treated for depression at the time of his 2024 trial, and had\nattempted suicide sometime before trial, would provide limited insight into why he\nappeared nonchalant years earlier when Carrillo’s death was discovered in 2019. 1 (Cf.\nPeople v. Gana (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9807191\"><a href=\"/opinion/2798788/people-v-gana/#612\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Gana\">236 Cal.App.4th 598, 612</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) On this record, we cannot say the\ntrial court abused its discretion in excluding that evidence.\n       We acknowledge the possibility that the trial court’s ruling may have resulted in\nthe exclusion of other, relevant evidence. In discussing the scope of permissible\ntestimony about defendant’s past and current mental condition (including medications he\nwas then receiving at the jail), defense counsel emphasized that defendant had “been\ntreated for depression since he was a child.” The court reiterated that defendant could say\nhe was “depressed” in 2019 but could not “talk about his psychiatric diagnosis.” The\n\n\n       1\n         Although the relevant portions of the record do not indicate when defendant’s\nsuicide attempt occurred, other information in the record suggests it may have taken place\nin 2023.\n                                             14\n\fcourt had sustained an objection to counsel’s attempt to question defendant about his\nmental condition at the time of trial, and the court also precluded defendant’s testimony\nabout a depressive diagnosis, even if that diagnosis preceded the charged murder. But\neven assuming the scope of the court’s ruling resulted in the erroneous exclusion of\nevidence relating to defendant’s mental health in 2019, we see no reasonable probability\nof a different result had such evidence been admitted. Defendant’s demeanor\nimmediately following Carrillo’s death was a marginal issue, defendant provided an\nexplanation for his demeanor that did not depend on the excluded evidence, and other\nevidence pointed strongly to defendant’s direct involvement in the murder. Any possible\nerror was not prejudicial under the applicable state-law standard.\n   C. DEFENDANT’S SENTENCE IS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY CRUEL OR UNUSUAL\n       Defendant argues his mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole—for a murder committed when he was 25 years old—violates the California\nConstitution’s prohibition on cruel or unusual punishment. The power to define\npunishment for crimes is a legislative function, so we proceed with deference when there\nis a constitutional challenge to the length of a prison term. (People v. Baker (2018)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6106332\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239420/people-v-baker/#729\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Baker\">20 Cal.App.5th 711, 729</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) A punishment is cruel or unusual only if it “is so\ndisproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and\noffends fundamental notions of human dignity.” (In re Lynch (1972) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9563448\"><a href=\"/opinion/1210303/in-re-lynch/#424\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In Re Lynch\">8 Cal.3d 410, 424</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\nRelevant considerations include “(1) the nature of the offense and the nature of the\noffender with regard to the degree of danger both present to society, (2) a comparison of\nthe punishment with the punishments prescribed for more serious crimes in the\njurisdiction, and (3) a comparison of the punishment with punishments for the same\noffense in other jurisdictions.” (People v. Guenther (2024) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">104 Cal.App.5th 483</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532–\n533, citing In re Lynch, at pp. 425–427.)\n       In support of his constitutional claim, defendant references his “youth, his\nethnicity, and the conditions of the Main Jail in Santa Cruz County,” where the crime\n                                             15\n\foccurred. We recognize defendant was 25 years old at the time of the murder. As he\nacknowledges, the California Supreme Court has found a rational basis for the\nLegislature’s “exclusion of offenders who are serving sentences of life in prison without\nthe possibility of parole for a crime committed after the age of 18 from youth offender\nparole eligibility” under section 3051, subdivision (h). (People v. Hardin (2024)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">15 Cal.5th 834</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864.) Although Hardin involved an equal protection claim, not a claim\nof cruel or unusual punishment, the Supreme Court’s holding undermines defendant’s\nargument that a life sentence for a murder committed at age 25 is so disproportionate in\nlight of youth as to be unconstitutional.\n         Defendant refers to “his ethnicity” and the existence of sentencing disparities\nbased on race or ethnicity, but he does not explain how that renders the sentence\ndisproportionate in this case. Nor does he explain how what he describes as dangerous\nconditions and lax security measures at the jail in 2019 render him less culpable for the\nmurder of a fellow inmate. He offers no comparison between his punishment and the\npunishments prescribed for more serious crimes in the same jurisdiction, or for the same\ncrime in other jurisdictions. Defendant has not met his burden of establishing that his\nsentence is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual.\n   D. IMPOSITION OF A PAROLE REVOCATION FINE\n         The parties both view the parole revocation fine as erroneously imposed given\ndefendant’s sentence on count 1 to life without the possibility of parole. We\nacknowledge the parties’ logic, but we disagree with its application based on Supreme\nCourt precedent and we therefore do not accept the Attorney General’s concession on the\npoint.\n         Section 1202.45, subdivision (a) states: “In every case where a person is\nconvicted of a crime and his or her sentence includes a period of parole, the court shall, at\nthe time of imposing the restitution fine pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.4,\nassess an additional parole revocation restitution fine in the same amount as that imposed\n                                              16\n\fpursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.4.” In addition to the life term and 10-year\nenhancement imposed on count 1, defendant also received a concurrent determinate\nsentence of two years in prison on count 2. His sentence therefore technically “ ‘includes\na period of parole,’ ” however unlikely he is to ever spend time on parole, and a parole\nrevocation fine was statutorily required. (§ 1202.45, subd. (a); People v. Baker (2021)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal.5th 1044</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1108–1109.) As the Supreme Court has reasoned, “[d]efendant is in no\nway prejudiced by assessment of the fine, which will become payable only if he actually\ndoes begin serving a period of parole and his parole is revoked.” (People v. Brasure\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622990\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622990/people-v-brasure/#1075\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

Whether Unicoi County Court err[ed] in denying Petitioner access to Court by\n       vehicle of habeas corpus?\n\nThe Defendant alleges that he was arrested illegally, that the trial court denied him counsel\nin violation of his constitutional rights, and that the trial court refused to hear a petition for\na writ of habeas corpus.

Although the Defendant included a different\ndocket number in the instant pleading, the matters appear to be procedurally related, and the Defendant\nmakes allegations similar to those raised in the previous case.\n\fgeneral sessions court previously determined the Defendant to be indigent, the costs\nassociated with this action are taxed to the State of Tennessee.\n\n\n                                      JUDGE STEVEN W.

These charges stemmed from an incident that took place on February\n20, 2022. At trial, Defendant was acquitted of attempted second degree murder, but the\njury found him guilty of the remaining counts. 1 At issue in this appeal are the convictions\nin counts two, three, and five.\n\n       On January 17, 2022, Defendant’s wife, Whitney Collins, told Defendant she\nwanted a divorce. At that time, Defendant, a trooper with the Tennessee Highway Patrol\n(“THP”), and Ms. Collins had been married for eleven years and had two minor children.\nFour days later, on January 21, 2022, Ms. Collins, along with the couple’s children, moved\ninto the home of her mother, June Gibson, and her stepfather, Timothy Gibson, in\nKingsport, Tennessee.\n\n        Ms. Collins described Defendant’s behavior after she and the children moved out as\n“erratic,” attributing Defendant’s behavior to his increased alcohol use. After Ms. Collins\nmoved out, Defendant sent her text messages that she considered to be of a “scary or\nthreatening nature.” In mid-February 2022, Defendant sent Ms. Collins close to fifty text\nmessages, one of which read in part, “I know where you are every day. And I can prove it\nto you by showing you the picture of it, but I’m not going to do that.” Ms. Collins testified\nthat Defendant’s text messages left her feeling like she was never safe because it was\napparent that Defendant was tracking her. On February 16, 2022, Defendant texted Ms.\nCollins a photograph of the heart-shaped container which held her father’s cremains and\ntwo vials which held her father’s final EKG tracings before he died. Defendant then sent\nher a video recording showing him throwing those items into the trash, along with a\nmessage that said, “Now I just took your dad away from you.”\n\n        Ms. Collins testified that Defendant’s text messages and his erratic behavior made\nher feel like “she was in danger.” Defendant had been on the S.W.A.T. team for a while,\nhad experience with guns, and owned “a lot” of guns; she knew Defendant always carried\na firearm. Based on Defendant’s actions, Ms. Collins filed for and was granted an ex parte\norder of protection on February 17, 2022. In addition to directing Defendant to have no\ncontact with Ms. Collins or their minor children, the order of protection specifically\nprohibited Defendant from putting Ms. Collins and the couple’s minor children “in fear of\nbeing hurt or in fear of not being able to leave or get away.” The order also put Defendant\non notice that “[i]f you try to hurt anyone while this Order, probation, or diversion is in\neffect, you may face separate charges for aggravated assault, a Class C felony.”\n\n       On February 18, 2022, Lieutenant Michael Foster of the Washington County\nSheriff’s Office served Defendant with the order of protection at Defendant’s home. A\ncopy of the order was exhibited to his testimony. Lieutenant Foster explained to Defendant\n\n  1\n      The State dismissed the assault charge in count four on the morning of the trial.\n                                                -2-\n\fthat he could have no contact with Ms. Collins or their minor children and that if a\npermanent order of protection were subsequently granted, Defendant would lose his right\nto possess a firearm. Lieutenant Foster testified that Defendant acted in a “disorderly\nmanner” when he was served with the order of protection and video from his body worn\ncamera documenting Defendant’s behavior was exhibited to his testimony. The video\nshowed that Defendant was initially cordial and respectful, but his demeanor changed when\nhe was informed about the order of protection. Defendant then became argumentative,\ncursing at Lieutenant Foster and making statements such as “I know more than you. Look\nat who you are talking to” and “I am the law.” Defendant made threats that “he would do\nwhat he felt he wanted to do” and hit both his own truck and his THP vehicle with his fists.\nDefendant threw the copy of the order of protection on the ground. Sergeant Moore and\nTrooper Blankenship from THP were also present and attempted to calm Defendant. They\nwere there to retrieve Defendant’s state equipment and inform Defendant that he was being\nplaced on administrative leave.\n\n        Suspecting that Defendant was tracking her van, Ms. Collins began driving her\nmother’s car. She also began to keep a gun, given to her by her stepfather, in her bedroom.\nWhen asked why she felt the need to take these extra precautions, Ms. Collins replied that\nshe “felt imminent danger” and was “constantly looking over [her] shoulder.”\nAdditionally, the Gibson house was equipped with a security system that included an\nexterior surveillance camera and motion sensors. Mr. Gibson testified that after Ms.\nCollins obtained the order of protection, he installed even more motion sensors around the\narea where they parked their vehicles. Mr. Gibson stated that Defendant was aware of the\nsecurity system but was not aware of the newly added motion sensors. Mr. Gibson\ncontrolled the security camera through an application (“app”) on his cell phone and iPad.\nActivation of the motion sensors set off an alarm inside the house.\n\n        Mr. Gibson and Ms. Collins both testified that on February 20, 2022, around 3:00\na.m., all the outdoor motion sensors at the Gibson home simultaneously alerted. Awakened\nby the noise, Mr. Gibson attempted to access his exterior surveillance camera through his\ncell phone but discovered a communication failure. Mr. Gibson then got out of bed, put\non his bathrobe, and grabbed his handgun. He went to the living room, where he was joined\nby Ms. Collins. When he attempted to check the surveillance camera from his iPad, Mr.\nGibson found that it also indicated a communication failure, even after he rebooted the\nsystem. Ms. Collins testified that after having been awakened by the alarm system and\nlearning that Mr. Gibson could not check the cameras, she was shaking and scared and had\na “feeling of doom.” The two went into the garage and when Mr. Gibson opened the back\ndoor, he heard the “loud hiss” of air coming from a tire. He told Ms. Collins to stay inside\nthe house as he proceeded to investigate outside. Mr. Gibson testified that he felt\n“unnerved” when he was woken from sleep and found that his tires were going flat. While\ninspecting the cars, Mr. Gibson heard the sounds of sticks breaking and crunching on the\n                                           -3-\n\ffrozen ground. He headed in the direction of the sounds and saw Defendant’s truck parked\nthirty or forty yards down the road with its taillights illuminated.\n\n       As Mr. Gibson was looking around outside, Ms. Collins, who was inside the house,\ncalled 911 and went to the front door. When she opened the front door, she could see all\nthe way down the driveway, and she saw Defendant as he ran down the driveway toward\nthe road. Ms. Collins began screaming into the phone, “He’s here, he’s here.” At trial,\nMs. Collins recalled that when she saw Defendant, she was “scared that he was going to\ndo something to hurt me.” While on the phone with the 911 operator, Ms. Collins\nremembered that Defendant had recently given the couple’s daughter an iPhone and had\nenabled the phone to share its location with his iPhone. When Ms. Collins opened the Find\nMy iPhone app on her daughter’s phone, she saw that Defendant had been at the Gibson\nhome eight minutes earlier. She took a screenshot showing the location which she later\ngave to the police. Ms. Collins then joined Mr. Gibson outside, and they walked to the\nbottom of the driveway where they saw Defendant’s truck driving away from the house.\n\n        Mr. Gibson admitted that although he recognized Defendant’s truck, he did not\nactually see Defendant. However, he believed Defendant was at his house that night and\nhe was “concerned” because of the existing issues between Defendant and Ms. Collins.\nMr. Gibson also admitted that Defendant never spoke to or made any verbal threats to him\nor Ms. Collins that night. Ms. Collins also confirmed that Defendant did not speak to her\nor make any verbal threats. While both Mr. Gibson and Ms. Collins testified that Defendant\nalways carried a gun, neither saw him brandish a firearm that night. Ms. Collins assumed\nhe had a gun “because he always had his gun on him” but admitted she could not see him\ncarrying one that night. She explained that she feared Defendant had a weapon with him\nthat night and thought he was going to cause her bodily injury.\n\n        Deputy Brandon Trivett of the Sullivan County Sheriff’s Office responded to the\n911 call at the Gibson home around 3:00 a.m. on February 20, 2022. When he arrived at\nthe Gibson house, he saw gouge marks on the rims of two cars in the driveway and observed\nthat their valve stems had been cut. He also observed that the wires to the security camera\nhad been cut. Additionally, Ms. Collins reported to him that her license plate had been\nstolen from her van. While on scene, Deputy Trivett reviewed text messages between\nDefendant and Ms. Collins, including one in which Ms. Collins advised Defendant to stop\ncontacting her. However, Defendant continued sending messages, including ones in which\nhe claimed to know her whereabouts “at all times.”\n\n       Ms. Collins also gave her daughter’s cell phone to Deputy Trivett, and he relayed\ninformation regarding Defendant’s location from the Find My iPhone app to other officers.\nShortly thereafter, Defendant was stopped without incident and taken into custody. He was\ntransported to the Sullivan County Jail, where the arresting officer gave Deputy Trivett\n                                           -4-\n\fitems recovered from Defendant’s truck during an inventory search conducted by Trooper\nEllison. Deputy Trivett documented a holster, a magazine for a BB rifle, two magazines\nfor a handgun, nine-millimeter hollow-point ammunition, a Smith & Wesson nine-\nmillimeter handgun, and an AR-style BB rifle and placed all the items in the evidence\nlocker.\n\n       Defendant testified and admitted that his conduct when served with the order of\nprotection was “unacceptable.” He said he assumed that he was being served with divorce\npapers, not an order of protection. He was upset because his job was being affected by the\norder of protection, and he was hurt because he could not see his children. He said his\nemotions led him to act in an inappropriate manner “very out of character for him.”\nDefendant also admitted that he had drunk alcohol the prior night and called in sick to work\nthe day he was served with the order of protection. He said he was still feeling the effects\nof his alcohol consumption and “blame[ed] it all on the alcohol.” However, Defendant\ndenied that he had “a drinking problem” and said, “I had a wife problem.”\n\n        Defendant admitted that he went to the Gibson house early on February 20, 2022,\neven though he knew the order of protection prohibited him from being around his wife\nand children. He explained that the van his wife drove was equipped with an app that\nallowed him to track it. He had used the app to track Ms. Collins and noted that one night\nshe was at a house he recognized as belonging to another man. He took a screenshot of the\nlocation to use as evidence at the upcoming hearing on the order of protection. Defendant\nknew Ms. Collins was driving her parents’ vehicles and reasoned that if he went to the\nGibson house and disabled her parents’ vehicles, Ms. Collins “couldn’t drive them cars and\nshe would have to drive her van.” Then, he could track the van to document her\nwhereabouts. Defendant admitted to cutting the valve stems on the Gibsons’ car tires for\nthe same reason. He also admitted to cutting the security camera wire, but said it was only\nintended to inconvenience Mr. Gibson, whom he claimed had lied about taking the van for\nan oil change. Defendant did not think cutting the camera wires and preventing Mr. Gibson\nfrom seeing outside would cause Mr. Gibson to be afraid. Defendant claimed he was not\nangry when he went to the Gibson house. When asked if he was calm that night, Defendant\nreplied, “I knew what I was doing.”\n\n        Defendant denied having any intention of entering the house that night and claimed\nhe did not go to the house to frighten his in-laws, his wife, or his children. Defendant said\nhe had a key to the Gibson home and could have entered had he wanted to, but he never\ntried to do so. He stated that he moved away from the house after cutting the security\ncamera wire. Several times during his testimony, Defendant admitted he always carried a\npistol, and he agreed that it was always loaded. However, he denied having a weapon on\nhim when he was at the Gibson house on February 20, 2022, even though a handgun was\nrecovered from his truck when he was arrested.\n                                            -5-\n\f       Based on the evidence above, the jury convicted Defendant as charged of domestic\nassault and aggravated domestic assault of Whitney Collins, and assault of Timothy\nGibson. The trial court imposed an effective sentence of seven and one-half years’\nincarceration. Defendant filed a timely motion for new trial which the trial court denied\non May 9, 2024.\n\n       Defendant’s timely appeal is now before this court.\n\n                                          Analysis\n\n        Defendant asserts that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support his\nconvictions for domestic assault (count 2), assault (count 3), and aggravated domestic\nassault (count 5). Specifically, Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence that\nhe acted intentionally or knowingly to cause the victims to reasonably fear imminent bodily\ninjury to support counts two and three and as such, the State failed to prove the underlying\nassault of Ms. Collins, as required to support count five. The State contends that the\nevidence is sufficient for each conviction. We agree with the State.\n\n        When evaluating the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, the relevant question is\nwhether “any reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Wagner, 382 S.W.3d 289, 297 (Tenn. 2012) (quoting\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)); see Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e). The State is\nentitled to the strongest legitimate view of the evidence presented at trial and to all\nreasonable and legitimate inferences that may be drawn from the evidence. State v. Gibson,\n506 S.W.3d 450, 458 (Tenn. 2016). This court will not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence,\nand it may not substitute its inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence for those drawn\nby the trier of fact. State v. Davis, 466 S.W.3d 49, 70 (Tenn. 2015). A jury’s verdict of\nguilt, approved by the trial court, resolves conflicts of evidence in the State’s favor and\naccredits the testimony of the State’s witnesses. State v. Smith, 436 S.W.3d 751, 764 (Tenn.\n2014). “Questions concerning the credibility of witnesses, the weight and value to be given\nthe evidence, as well as all factual issues raised by the evidence are resolved by the trier of\nfact.” State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651, 659 (Tenn. 1997).\n\n       A guilty verdict replaces the presumption of innocence with one of guilt, and on\nappeal, the burden of demonstrating that the evidence is insufficient to support the\nconviction is on the defendant. State v. Cole, 155 S.W.3d 885, 897 (Tenn. 2005). This\nstandard of review applies to guilty verdicts based upon direct or circumstantial evidence.\nState v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 370, 379 (Tenn. 2011) (citing State v. Hanson, 279 S.W.3d\n265, 275 (Tenn. 2009)). In Dorantes, this Court adopted the United States Supreme Court\nstandard that “direct and circumstantial evidence should be treated the same when\nweighing the sufficiency of such evidence.” Id. at 381. A conviction may be supported\n                                             -6-\n\fentirely by circumstantial evidence alone, and contrary to Defendant’s assertion, such\ncircumstantial evidence is not required to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except the\ndefendant’s guilt. State v. Tuttle, 515 S.W.3d 282, 316 (Tenn. 2017).\n\n       As charged in this case, an assault occurs when a person “intentionally or knowingly\ncauses another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury.” T.C.A. § 39-13-101(a)(2). A\nperson acts intentionally “with respect to the nature of the conduct or to a result of the\nconduct when it is the person’s conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or\ncause the result.” Id. § 39-11-302(a). “Knowing”\n\n       refers to a person who acts knowingly with respect to the conduct or to\n       circumstances surrounding the conduct when the person is aware of the\n       nature of the conduct or that the circumstances exist. A person acts\n       knowingly with respect to a result of the person’s conduct when the person\n       is aware that the conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.\n\nId. § 39-11-302(b).\n\n       Domestic assault is “an assault as defined in § 39-13-101 against a domestic abuse\nvictim.” Id. § 39-13-111(b). A domestic abuse victim is any adult “who [is a] current or\nformer spouse.” Id. § 39-13-111(a)(1).\n\n       As charged in this case, aggravated domestic assault is committed by one “who,\nafter having been enjoined or restrained by an order, diversion or probation agreement of\na court of competent jurisdiction from in any way. . . committing or attempting to commit\nan assault against an individual or individuals, intentionally or knowingly. . . commits or\nattempts to commit an assault against the individual or individuals.” Id. § 39-13-102(c).\n\n       On the date of the offense, Defendant and Ms. Collins were married; thus, Ms.\nCollins was a domestic abuse victim, see id. § 39-13-111(a)(1), and Defendant does not\ndispute that she was. However, Defendant argues that the State’s evidence did not prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant acted intentionally or knowingly to cause Ms.\nCollins and Mr. Gibson to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury and that the victims did\nnot reasonably fear imminent bodily injury.\n\n       Our supreme court has defined “imminent” as:\n\n       Near at hand; mediate rather than immediate; close rather than touching;\n       impending; on the point of happening; threatening; menacing; perilous.\n       Something which is threatening to happen at once, something close at hand,\n\n                                           -7-\n\f       something to happen upon the instant, close although not yet touching, and\n       on the point of happening.\n\nState v. Payne, 7 S.W.3d 25, 28 (Tenn. 1999) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 750 (6th\ned. 1990)). This definition emphasizes the immediacy and proximity of the perceived\nthreat rather than the actual occurrence of harm. This court has held that “[t]he element of\n‘fear’ is satisfied if the circumstances of the incident, within reason and common\nexperience, are of such a nature as to cause a person to reasonably fear bodily injury.” State\nv. Cummings, No. M2023-01345-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3412259, at *9 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. July 15, 2024) (quoting State v. Jackson, No. M2019-01128-CCA-R3-CD, 2020 WL\n2488763, at *13 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 14, 2020)). Thus, actual danger is not an element\nof assault committed by placing a victim in reasonable fear of imminent harm. Instead, the\nfocus is on whether the victim’s fear of imminent bodily injury was reasonable under the\ncircumstances. See id.\n\n       This court has explained the nature of the fear of imminent bodily injury as\n\n       [t]he fear contemplated by the statute is not the fear of . . . the perpetrator,\n       but the fear or reasonable apprehension of being harmed. As acknowledged\n       by the [defendant], an assault has been defined as an act which conveys to\n       the mind of the person set upon a well[-]grounded apprehension of personal\n       injury or violence. The element of “fear” is satisfied if the circumstances of\n       the incident, within reason and common experience, are of such a nature as\n       to cause a person to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury.\n\nState v. Stallings, No. E2005-00239-CCA-R3-CD, 2006 WL 2061736, at *20 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. July 26, 2006) (quoting State v. Whitfield, No. 02C01-9706-CR-00226, 1998 WL\n227776 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 8, 1998) (internal citation omitted)).\n\n        The proof in this case showed that Defendant knew that at 3:00 a.m., his wife and\nchildren as well as his wife’s parents would be home. Defendant had been tracking Ms.\nCollins’ van which along with the Gibsons’ vehicles was in the driveway when Defendant\narrived. Defendant acknowledged that he was prohibited by the order of protection from\nvisiting the Gibson house and said he should not have been there. He also admitted to\nslashing the tires and cutting the valve stems on the tires of two vehicles, making them\nundrivable. He confessed to cutting the wire on the exterior surveillance camera, which he\nknew Mr. Gibson used to monitor the security of the home. For weeks, Defendant had\nbeen sending Ms. Collins threatening text messages. Ms. Collins testified that she knew\nDefendant always carried a loaded weapon. When the security alarm woke her, she felt a\n“feeling of doom” and said she was scared and shaking. When she saw Defendant in the\ndriveway, she was “scared that he was going to do something to hurt me.”\n                                            -8-\n\f      Mr. Gibson was aware of the order of protection Ms. Collins had obtained against\nDefendant and the underlying facts supporting the order. He testified that after being\nawakened by the alarm and discovering that the security cameras were malfunctioning, he\ngrabbed his gun before investigating because he was “unnerved.”\n\n       The evidence was sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that Defendant knew\nthat Ms. Collins and her parents would be home and that he intentionally or knowingly\ncaused them to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury. The jury heard and rejected\nDefendant’s argument that he went to the home to gather evidence for the order of\nprotection hearing. The jury considered the testimony and each witness’s credibility\nregarding every element of the assault charges, including Defendant’s mental state. This\ncourt has stated that when evaluating a defendant’s intent, the jury may consider “the\ncharacter of the assault, the nature of the act and all of the circumstances of the case in\nevidence.” State v. Inlow, 52 S.W.3d 101, 105 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000) (citing State v.\nHolland, 860 S.W.2d 53, 59 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993)).\n\n        Regarding Defendant’s conviction for aggravated domestic assault against Ms.\nCollins, Defendant also argues that there was no evidence that he used or displayed a\nweapon. However, the presentment charged Defendant with intentionally or knowingly\ncausing Ms. Collins to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury after having been enjoined\nor restrained by an order of protection and the jury was charged accordingly. The evidence\nclearly showed that an order of protection had been issued and served on Defendant when\nthe assault on Ms. Collins occurred on February 20, 2022. Defendant’s argument is without\nmerit.\n\n                                       Conclusion\n\n        For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the\njury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant intentionally or knowingly caused\nthe victims to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury to support his convictions. We affirm\nthe judgments of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 S/   Jill Bartee Ayers\n                                                 JILL BARTEE AYERS, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f",

WILSON, JJ., joined.\n\nJoseph W. McMurray and R. Wayne Culbertson, Kingsport, Tennessee, for the appellant,\nNicholas S. Collins.\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter; Caroline Weldon, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Barry P. Staubus, District Attorney General; and Kaylin K. Render, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n                         Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      On August 10, 2022, the Sullivan County Grand Jury issued a presentment in case\nnumber S75901 charging Defendant with the following counts: (1) attempted second\ndegree murder, (2) domestic assault, (3 &amp; 4) assault, (5) aggravated domestic assault, (6)\nvandalism of $2,500 or more, but less than $10,000, (7) harassment, and (8) attempted\n\faggravated burglary. These charges stemmed from an incident that took place on February\n20, 2022. At trial, Defendant was acquitted of attempted second degree murder, but the\njury found him guilty of the remaining counts. 1 At issue in this appeal are the convictions\nin counts two, three, and five.\n\n       On January 17, 2022, Defendant’s wife, Whitney Collins, told Defendant she\nwanted a divorce. At that time, Defendant, a trooper with the Tennessee Highway Patrol\n(“THP”), and Ms. Collins had been married for eleven years and had two minor children.\nFour days later, on January 21, 2022, Ms. Collins, along with the couple’s children, moved\ninto the home of her mother, June Gibson, and her stepfather, Timothy Gibson, in\nKingsport, Tennessee.\n\n        Ms. Collins described Defendant’s behavior after she and the children moved out as\n“erratic,” attributing Defendant’s behavior to his increased alcohol use. After Ms. Collins\nmoved out, Defendant sent her text messages that she considered to be of a “scary or\nthreatening nature.” In mid-February 2022, Defendant sent Ms. Collins close to fifty text\nmessages, one of which read in part, “I know where you are every day. And I can prove it\nto you by showing you the picture of it, but I’m not going to do that.” Ms. Collins testified\nthat Defendant’s text messages left her feeling like she was never safe because it was\napparent that Defendant was tracking her. On February 16, 2022, Defendant texted Ms.\nCollins a photograph of the heart-shaped container which held her father’s cremains and\ntwo vials which held her father’s final EKG tracings before he died. Defendant then sent\nher a video recording showing him throwing those items into the trash, along with a\nmessage that said, “Now I just took your dad away from you.”\n\n        Ms. Collins testified that Defendant’s text messages and his erratic behavior made\nher feel like “she was in danger.” Defendant had been on the S.W.A.T. team for a while,\nhad experience with guns, and owned “a lot” of guns; she knew Defendant always carried\na firearm. Based on Defendant’s actions, Ms. Collins filed for and was granted an ex parte\norder of protection on February 17, 2022. In addition to directing Defendant to have no\ncontact with Ms. Collins or their minor children, the order of protection specifically\nprohibited Defendant from putting Ms. Collins and the couple’s minor children “in fear of\nbeing hurt or in fear of not being able to leave or get away.” The order also put Defendant\non notice that “[i]f you try to hurt anyone while this Order, probation, or diversion is in\neffect, you may face separate charges for aggravated assault, a Class C felony.”\n\n       On February 18, 2022, Lieutenant Michael Foster of the Washington County\nSheriff’s Office served Defendant with the order of protection at Defendant’s home. A\ncopy of the order was exhibited to his testimony. Lieutenant Foster explained to Defendant\n\n  1\n      The State dismissed the assault charge in count four on the morning of the trial.\n                                                -2-\n\fthat he could have no contact with Ms. Collins or their minor children and that if a\npermanent order of protection were subsequently granted, Defendant would lose his right\nto possess a firearm. Lieutenant Foster testified that Defendant acted in a “disorderly\nmanner” when he was served with the order of protection and video from his body worn\ncamera documenting Defendant’s behavior was exhibited to his testimony. The video\nshowed that Defendant was initially cordial and respectful, but his demeanor changed when\nhe was informed about the order of protection. Defendant then became argumentative,\ncursing at Lieutenant Foster and making statements such as “I know more than you. Look\nat who you are talking to” and “I am the law.” Defendant made threats that “he would do\nwhat he felt he wanted to do” and hit both his own truck and his THP vehicle with his fists.\nDefendant threw the copy of the order of protection on the ground. Sergeant Moore and\nTrooper Blankenship from THP were also present and attempted to calm Defendant. They\nwere there to retrieve Defendant’s state equipment and inform Defendant that he was being\nplaced on administrative leave.\n\n        Suspecting that Defendant was tracking her van, Ms. Collins began driving her\nmother’s car. She also began to keep a gun, given to her by her stepfather, in her bedroom.\nWhen asked why she felt the need to take these extra precautions, Ms. Collins replied that\nshe “felt imminent danger” and was “constantly looking over [her] shoulder.”\nAdditionally, the Gibson house was equipped with a security system that included an\nexterior surveillance camera and motion sensors. Mr. Gibson testified that after Ms.\nCollins obtained the order of protection, he installed even more motion sensors around the\narea where they parked their vehicles. Mr. Gibson stated that Defendant was aware of the\nsecurity system but was not aware of the newly added motion sensors. Mr. Gibson\ncontrolled the security camera through an application (“app”) on his cell phone and iPad.\nActivation of the motion sensors set off an alarm inside the house.\n\n        Mr. Gibson and Ms. Collins both testified that on February 20, 2022, around 3:00\na.m., all the outdoor motion sensors at the Gibson home simultaneously alerted. Awakened\nby the noise, Mr. Gibson attempted to access his exterior surveillance camera through his\ncell phone but discovered a communication failure. Mr. Gibson then got out of bed, put\non his bathrobe, and grabbed his handgun. He went to the living room, where he was joined\nby Ms. Collins. When he attempted to check the surveillance camera from his iPad, Mr.\nGibson found that it also indicated a communication failure, even after he rebooted the\nsystem. Ms. Collins testified that after having been awakened by the alarm system and\nlearning that Mr. Gibson could not check the cameras, she was shaking and scared and had\na “feeling of doom.” The two went into the garage and when Mr. Gibson opened the back\ndoor, he heard the “loud hiss” of air coming from a tire. He told Ms. Collins to stay inside\nthe house as he proceeded to investigate outside. Mr. Gibson testified that he felt\n“unnerved” when he was woken from sleep and found that his tires were going flat. While\ninspecting the cars, Mr. Gibson heard the sounds of sticks breaking and crunching on the\n                                           -3-\n\ffrozen ground. He headed in the direction of the sounds and saw Defendant’s truck parked\nthirty or forty yards down the road with its taillights illuminated.\n\n       As Mr. Gibson was looking around outside, Ms. Collins, who was inside the house,\ncalled 911 and went to the front door. When she opened the front door, she could see all\nthe way down the driveway, and she saw Defendant as he ran down the driveway toward\nthe road. Ms. Collins began screaming into the phone, “He’s here, he’s here.” At trial,\nMs. Collins recalled that when she saw Defendant, she was “scared that he was going to\ndo something to hurt me.” While on the phone with the 911 operator, Ms. Collins\nremembered that Defendant had recently given the couple’s daughter an iPhone and had\nenabled the phone to share its location with his iPhone. When Ms. Collins opened the Find\nMy iPhone app on her daughter’s phone, she saw that Defendant had been at the Gibson\nhome eight minutes earlier. She took a screenshot showing the location which she later\ngave to the police. Ms. Collins then joined Mr. Gibson outside, and they walked to the\nbottom of the driveway where they saw Defendant’s truck driving away from the house.\n\n        Mr. Gibson admitted that although he recognized Defendant’s truck, he did not\nactually see Defendant. However, he believed Defendant was at his house that night and\nhe was “concerned” because of the existing issues between Defendant and Ms. Collins.\nMr. Gibson also admitted that Defendant never spoke to or made any verbal threats to him\nor Ms. Collins that night. Ms. Collins also confirmed that Defendant did not speak to her\nor make any verbal threats. While both Mr. Gibson and Ms. Collins testified that Defendant\nalways carried a gun, neither saw him brandish a firearm that night. Ms. Collins assumed\nhe had a gun “because he always had his gun on him” but admitted she could not see him\ncarrying one that night. She explained that she feared Defendant had a weapon with him\nthat night and thought he was going to cause her bodily injury.\n\n        Deputy Brandon Trivett of the Sullivan County Sheriff’s Office responded to the\n911 call at the Gibson home around 3:00 a.m. on February 20, 2022. When he arrived at\nthe Gibson house, he saw gouge marks on the rims of two cars in the driveway and observed\nthat their valve stems had been cut. He also observed that the wires to the security camera\nhad been cut. Additionally, Ms. Collins reported to him that her license plate had been\nstolen from her van. While on scene, Deputy Trivett reviewed text messages between\nDefendant and Ms. Collins, including one in which Ms. Collins advised Defendant to stop\ncontacting her. However, Defendant continued sending messages, including ones in which\nhe claimed to know her whereabouts “at all times.”\n\n       Ms. Collins also gave her daughter’s cell phone to Deputy Trivett, and he relayed\ninformation regarding Defendant’s location from the Find My iPhone app to other officers.\nShortly thereafter, Defendant was stopped without incident and taken into custody. He was\ntransported to the Sullivan County Jail, where the arresting officer gave Deputy Trivett\n                                           -4-\n\fitems recovered from Defendant’s truck during an inventory search conducted by Trooper\nEllison. Deputy Trivett documented a holster, a magazine for a BB rifle, two magazines\nfor a handgun, nine-millimeter hollow-point ammunition, a Smith &amp; Wesson nine-\nmillimeter handgun, and an AR-style BB rifle and placed all the items in the evidence\nlocker.\n\n       Defendant testified and admitted that his conduct when served with the order of\nprotection was “unacceptable.” He said he assumed that he was being served with divorce\npapers, not an order of protection. He was upset because his job was being affected by the\norder of protection, and he was hurt because he could not see his children. He said his\nemotions led him to act in an inappropriate manner “very out of character for him.”\nDefendant also admitted that he had drunk alcohol the prior night and called in sick to work\nthe day he was served with the order of protection. He said he was still feeling the effects\nof his alcohol consumption and “blame[ed] it all on the alcohol.” However, Defendant\ndenied that he had “a drinking problem” and said, “I had a wife problem.”\n\n        Defendant admitted that he went to the Gibson house early on February 20, 2022,\neven though he knew the order of protection prohibited him from being around his wife\nand children. He explained that the van his wife drove was equipped with an app that\nallowed him to track it. He had used the app to track Ms. Collins and noted that one night\nshe was at a house he recognized as belonging to another man. He took a screenshot of the\nlocation to use as evidence at the upcoming hearing on the order of protection. Defendant\nknew Ms. Collins was driving her parents’ vehicles and reasoned that if he went to the\nGibson house and disabled her parents’ vehicles, Ms. Collins “couldn’t drive them cars and\nshe would have to drive her van.” Then, he could track the van to document her\nwhereabouts. Defendant admitted to cutting the valve stems on the Gibsons’ car tires for\nthe same reason. He also admitted to cutting the security camera wire, but said it was only\nintended to inconvenience Mr. Gibson, whom he claimed had lied about taking the van for\nan oil change. Defendant did not think cutting the camera wires and preventing Mr. Gibson\nfrom seeing outside would cause Mr. Gibson to be afraid. Defendant claimed he was not\nangry when he went to the Gibson house. When asked if he was calm that night, Defendant\nreplied, “I knew what I was doing.”\n\n        Defendant denied having any intention of entering the house that night and claimed\nhe did not go to the house to frighten his in-laws, his wife, or his children. Defendant said\nhe had a key to the Gibson home and could have entered had he wanted to, but he never\ntried to do so. He stated that he moved away from the house after cutting the security\ncamera wire. Several times during his testimony, Defendant admitted he always carried a\npistol, and he agreed that it was always loaded. However, he denied having a weapon on\nhim when he was at the Gibson house on February 20, 2022, even though a handgun was\nrecovered from his truck when he was arrested.\n                                            -5-\n\f       Based on the evidence above, the jury convicted Defendant as charged of domestic\nassault and aggravated domestic assault of Whitney Collins, and assault of Timothy\nGibson. The trial court imposed an effective sentence of seven and one-half years’\nincarceration. Defendant filed a timely motion for new trial which the trial court denied\non May 9, 2024.\n\n       Defendant’s timely appeal is now before this court.\n\n                                          Analysis\n\n        Defendant asserts that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support his\nconvictions for domestic assault (count 2), assault (count 3), and aggravated domestic\nassault (count 5). Specifically, Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence that\nhe acted intentionally or knowingly to cause the victims to reasonably fear imminent bodily\ninjury to support counts two and three and as such, the State failed to prove the underlying\nassault of Ms. Collins, as required to support count five. The State contends that the\nevidence is sufficient for each conviction. We agree with the State.\n\n        When evaluating the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, the relevant question is\nwhether “any reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” State v.

Jerry Lewis Tuttle\">515 S.W.3d 282, 316</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 2017).\n\n       As charged in this case, an assault occurs when a person “intentionally or knowingly\ncauses another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury.” T.C.A. § 39-13-101(a)(2). A\nperson acts intentionally “with respect to the nature of the conduct or to a result of the\nconduct when it is the person’s conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or\ncause the result.” Id. § 39-11-302(a). “Knowing”\n\n       refers to a person who acts knowingly with respect to the conduct or to\n       circumstances surrounding the conduct when the person is aware of the\n       nature of the conduct or that the circumstances exist. A person acts\n       knowingly with respect to a result of the person’s conduct when the person\n       is aware that the conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.\n\nId. § 39-11-302(b).\n\n       Domestic assault is “an assault as defined in § 39-13-101 against a domestic abuse\nvictim.” Id. § 39-13-111(b). A domestic abuse victim is any adult “who [is a] current or\nformer spouse.” Id. § 39-13-111(a)(1).\n\n       As charged in this case, aggravated domestic assault is committed by one “who,\nafter having been enjoined or restrained by an order, diversion or probation agreement of\na court of competent jurisdiction from in any way. . . committing or attempting to commit\nan assault against an individual or individuals, intentionally or knowingly. . . commits or\nattempts to commit an assault against the individual or individuals.” Id. § 39-13-102(c).\n\n       On the date of the offense, Defendant and Ms. Collins were married; thus, Ms.\nCollins was a domestic abuse victim, see id. § 39-13-111(a)(1), and Defendant does not\ndispute that she was. However, Defendant argues that the State’s evidence did not prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant acted intentionally or knowingly to cause Ms.\nCollins and Mr. Gibson to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury and that the victims did\nnot reasonably fear imminent bodily injury.\n\n       Our supreme court has defined “imminent” as:\n\n       Near at hand; mediate rather than immediate; close rather than touching;\n       impending; on the point of happening; threatening; menacing; perilous.\n       Something which is threatening to happen at once, something close at hand,\n\n                                           -7-\n\f       something to happen upon the instant, close although not yet touching, and\n       on the point of happening.\n\nState v.

This definition emphasizes the immediacy and proximity of the perceived\nthreat rather than the actual occurrence of harm. This court has held that “[t]he element of\n‘fear’ is satisfied if the circumstances of the incident, within reason and common\nexperience, are of such a nature as to cause a person to reasonably fear bodily injury.” State\nv. Cummings, No. M2023-01345-CCA-R3-CD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 WL 3412259</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. July 15, 2024) (quoting State v.

Thus, actual danger is not an element\nof assault committed by placing a victim in reasonable fear of imminent harm. Instead, the\nfocus is on whether the victim’s fear of imminent bodily injury was reasonable under the\ncircumstances. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       This court has explained the nature of the fear of imminent bodily injury as\n\n       [t]he fear contemplated by the statute is not the fear of . . . the perpetrator,\n       but the fear or reasonable apprehension of being harmed. As acknowledged\n       by the [defendant], an assault has been defined as an act which conveys to\n       the mind of the person set upon a well[-]grounded apprehension of personal\n       injury or violence. The element of “fear” is satisfied if the circumstances of\n       the incident, within reason and common experience, are of such a nature as\n       to cause a person to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury.\n\nState v. Stallings, No. E2005-00239-CCA-R3-CD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2006 WL 2061736</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. July 26, 2006) (quoting State v.

App. May 8, 1998) (internal citation omitted)).\n\n        The proof in this case showed that Defendant knew that at 3:00 a.m., his wife and\nchildren as well as his wife’s parents would be home. Defendant had been tracking Ms.\nCollins’ van which along with the Gibsons’ vehicles was in the driveway when Defendant\narrived. Defendant acknowledged that he was prohibited by the order of protection from\nvisiting the Gibson house and said he should not have been there. He also admitted to\nslashing the tires and cutting the valve stems on the tires of two vehicles, making them\nundrivable. He confessed to cutting the wire on the exterior surveillance camera, which he\nknew Mr. Gibson used to monitor the security of the home. For weeks, Defendant had\nbeen sending Ms. Collins threatening text messages. Ms. Collins testified that she knew\nDefendant always carried a loaded weapon. When the security alarm woke her, she felt a\n“feeling of doom” and said she was scared and shaking. When she saw Defendant in the\ndriveway, she was “scared that he was going to do something to hurt me.”\n                                            -8-\n\f      Mr. Gibson was aware of the order of protection Ms. Collins had obtained against\nDefendant and the underlying facts supporting the order. He testified that after being\nawakened by the alarm and discovering that the security cameras were malfunctioning, he\ngrabbed his gun before investigating because he was “unnerved.”\n\n       The evidence was sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that Defendant knew\nthat Ms. Collins and her parents would be home and that he intentionally or knowingly\ncaused them to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury. The jury heard and rejected\nDefendant’s argument that he went to the home to gather evidence for the order of\nprotection hearing. The jury considered the testimony and each witness’s credibility\nregarding every element of the assault charges, including Defendant’s mental state. This\ncourt has stated that when evaluating a defendant’s intent, the jury may consider “the\ncharacter of the assault, the nature of the act and all of the circumstances of the case in\nevidence.” State v. Inlow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743633/state-v-inlow/#105\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v.

App. 1993)).\n\n        Regarding Defendant’s conviction for aggravated domestic assault against Ms.\nCollins, Defendant also argues that there was no evidence that he used or displayed a\nweapon. However, the presentment charged Defendant with intentionally or knowingly\ncausing Ms. Collins to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury after having been enjoined\nor restrained by an order of protection and the jury was charged accordingly. The evidence\nclearly showed that an order of protection had been issued and served on Defendant when\nthe assault on Ms. Collins occurred on February 20, 2022. Defendant’s argument is without\nmerit.\n\n                                       Conclusion\n\n        For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the\njury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant intentionally or knowingly caused\nthe victims to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury to support his convictions.

On May 6, 2016, Defendant pled guilty to Murder in the Second Degree and\n\nPossession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony. On August 2, 2016,\n\nthis Court sentenced Defendant to 30 years at Level V, suspended after 22 years\n\nfollowed by various Levels of probation for Murder in the Second Degree.\n\nDefendant was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of three years at Level V with\n\nno probation to follow for Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a\n\nFelony (“PFDCF”). Defendant received a total of 25 years unsuspended Level V\n\ntime.\n\f    2. Defendant has filed two previous Superior Court Criminal Rule 35(b) motions\n\nto reduce or modify his sentence. Both were denied. Defendant has now moved to\n\ncorrect an illegal sentence and seeks postconviction relief.\n\n    3. On June 30, 2025, Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief under\n\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 61. Defendant claims that his plea was not made\n\nknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently given the recent United States Supreme\n\nCourt decision, Erlinger v. United States.1 Defendant asserts that counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to inform Defendant of his rights under Erlinger.2\n\n    4. On July 14, 2025, Defendant filed a motion under Superior Court Criminal\n\nRule 35(a) for correction of an illegal sentence. Like his Rule 61 motion, Defendant\n\nargues that his sentence was illegally enhanced under Erlinger.3 For clarity, the\n\nCourt first addresses Defendant’s Rule 35(a) motion.\n\n    5. The Court “may correct an illegal sentence at any time”4 when the sentence\n       exceeds statutory limits, violates double jeopardy, is ambiguous with\n       respect to the time and manner in which it is to be served, is internally\n       contradictory, omits a term required to be imposed by statute, uncertain\n       as to its substance, or is a sentence that the judgment of conviction did\n       not authorize.5\n    6. In Erlinger, the United States Supreme Court recognized that when “any fact\n\n. . . increases the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is\n\n1\n  602 U.S. 821 (2024).\n2\n  Id.\n3\n  Id.\n4\n  Super. Ct. Crim. R. 35(a)–(b).\n5\n  Morris v. State, Del. Supr., No. 122, 2025, at 2–3, Traynor, J. (Sept. 3, 2025) (ORDER).\n\fexposed[,]” the Constitution mandates resolution “by a unanimous jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt (or freely admitted in a guilty plea).”6\n\n    7. Murder in the Second Degree is a Class A felony under Delaware law that\n\ncarries a minimum sentence of 15 years up to life at Level V.7 PFDCF is a Class B\n\nfelony that carries a minimum sentence of three years at Level V probation,\n\nnotwithstanding Sections 4205(b)(1) and 4215.8\n\n    8. The sentences imposed by this Court for Murder in the Second Degree and\n\nPFDCF were not enhanced. It was within the statutory limits and the Court’s\n\ndiscretion to sentence Defendant to 30 years at Level V suspended after 22 years for\n\nMurder in the Second Degree and to the mandatory minimum of three years for\n\nPFDCF.\n\n    9. Defendant’s Rule 35(a) motion lacks merit because the sentence imposed by\n\nthis Court was not illegal. Moreover, Defendant freely entered into a guilty plea,\n\nadmitting to the facts leading to his conviction. Accordingly, Erlinger is inapplicable\n\nhere. Thus, Defendant’s motion to correct an illegal sentence is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  602 U.S. at 334 (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also Morris, Del. Supr., No. 122, 2025, at 3–4.\n7\n  11 Del. C. § 635; 11 Del. C. § 4205(b)(1).\n8\n  11 Del. C. § 1447A(a)–(b).\n\f      10. Defendant also moved for postconviction relief.           There are various\n\nprocedural bars that a defendant must overcome before the merits of a claim may be\n\nconsidered. Specifically, a motion for postconviction relief\n\n          may not be filed more than one year after the judgment of conviction is\n          final or, if it asserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly\n          recognized after the judgment of conviction is final, more than one year\n          after the right is first recognized by the Supreme Court of Delaware or\n          by the United States Supreme Court.9\n      11. Defendant’s Rule 61 motion is untimely. Defendant was sentenced on\n\nAugust 2, 2016, and Defendant did not file a direct appeal. Defendant filed the\n\ninstant motion on June 30, 2025. Defendant, however, asserts that the constitutional\n\nlimitation on enhanced sentencing articulated in Erlinger is a retroactively\n\napplicable right. The Court disagrees. As discussed above, Defendant’s sentence\n\nwas not enhanced for either crime. Defendant was sentenced within the statutory\n\nlimits, Defendant freely entered into a guilty plea, and no previous crimes were\n\nconsidered by this Court in sentencing.\n\n      12. Consequently, there is no retroactively applicable right that applies to this\n\ncase, making the motion untimely and barred from being considered on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n9\n    Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1).\n\fThus,     Defendant’s       motion      for    postconviction       relief    is   SUMMARILY\n\nDISMISSED.10\n\n        IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                                                       /s/ Calvin L. Scott\n                                                       Judge Calvin L. Scott, Jr.\n\n\n\n\n10\n   “If it plainly appears from the motion for postconviction . . . that the movant is not entitled to\nrelief, the [court] may enter an order for its summary dismissal and cause the movant to be\nnotified.” Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(d)(5).\n\f",

Thus, Defendant’s motion to correct an illegal sentence is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11066653\"><a href=\"/opinion/10600063/erlinger-v-united-states/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Erlinger v.

C. § 4205(b)(1).\n8\n  11 Del. C. § 1447A(a)–(b).\n\f      10. Defendant also moved for postconviction relief.           There are various\n\nprocedural bars that a defendant must overcome before the merits of a claim may be\n\nconsidered. Specifically, a motion for postconviction relief\n\n          may not be filed more than one year after the judgment of conviction is\n          final or, if it asserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly\n          recognized after the judgment of conviction is final, more than one year\n          after the right is first recognized by the Supreme Court of Delaware or\n          by the United States Supreme Court.9\n      11. Defendant’s Rule 61 motion is untimely. Defendant was sentenced on\n\nAugust 2, 2016, and Defendant did not file a direct appeal. Defendant filed the\n\ninstant motion on June 30, 2025. Defendant, however, asserts that the constitutional\n\nlimitation on enhanced sentencing articulated in Erlinger is a retroactively\n\napplicable right. The Court disagrees. As discussed above, Defendant’s sentence\n\nwas not enhanced for either crime. Defendant was sentenced within the statutory\n\nlimits, Defendant freely entered into a guilty plea, and no previous crimes were\n\nconsidered by this Court in sentencing.\n\n      12. Consequently, there is no retroactively applicable right that applies to this\n\ncase, making the motion untimely and barred from being considered on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n9\n    Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1).\n\fThus,     Defendant’s       motion      for    postconviction       relief    is   SUMMARILY\n\nDISMISSED.10\n\n        IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                                                       /s/ Calvin L.

Scott, Jr.\n\n\n\n\n10\n   “If it plainly appears from the motion for postconviction . . . that the movant is not entitled to\nrelief, the [court] may enter an order for its summary dismissal and cause the movant to be\nnotified.” Super.

See\nTenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-315 (2023). The Defendant asserts that interlocutory review of\nthe trial court’s order is required to prevent irreparable injury to the Defendant; to prevent\nneedless, expensive, and protracted litigation; and to develop a uniform body of law.\nTenn. R. App. P. 9(a)(1), (2), and (3). The State has filed an answer in opposition to the\nDefendant’s application. Following our review, the Defendant’s application for\ninterlocutory appeal is DENIED.\n\n                                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       On September 14, 2023, the Defendant was charged via presentment with one count\nof aggravated stalking, alleging that, “between March 2023 and July 2023,” the Defendant\n“did unlawfully and intentionally stalk [the victim] while [he] was prohibited by [a] court\nordered restraining order from making contact with [the victim].”1 On October 3, 2024,\n\n        1\n            Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-315 (2023) defines stalking as “a willful course of\nconduct involving repeated or continuing harassment of another individual that would cause a reasonable\nperson to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested, and that actually causes\nthe victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested.” Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 39-17-315(a)(4). “Course of conduct” is defined as “a pattern of conduct composed of a series of two (2)\nor more separate, noncontinuous acts evidencing a continuity of purpose, including, but not limited to, acts\nin which the defendant directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or\nmeans, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to a person, or interferes with a\nperson’s property.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-315(a)(2). Harassment is defined as “conduct directed\ntoward a victim that includes, but is not limited to, repeated or continuing unconsented contact that would\ncause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress, and that actually causes the victim to suffer\n\fthe Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the presentment, asserting that Tennessee’s 2023\naggravated stalking statute is unconstitutional. The Defendant specifically argued that the\n2023 version of the aggravated stalking statute violates the First Amendment because the\nstatute does not require proof of a defendant’s understanding that his or her conduct is\nthreatening and only imposes an objective standard that a reasonable person would feel\nthreatened by the defendant’s statement. See Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66\n(2023).2\n\n      Following a hearing on the motion to dismiss, the trial court entered an order\ndenying the Defendant’s motion to dismiss.3 In so doing, the trial court distinguished\nTennessee’s statute from the Colorado statute analyzed in Counterman, noting that\n\n                Unlike its counterpart from Colorado, § 39-17-315 of our Code\n        requires a culpable mental state which does not run afoul of the\n        pronouncement in Counterman. The Tennessee statute requires the state\n        prove a defendant acted “willfully” and with a “continuity of purpose,”\n        thusly requiring the state to prove the defendant’s subjective intent.\n        Moreover, the statute is conjunctively framed, thereby, requiring the state to\n        not only prove the defendant’s willfulness, but the objective harm such\n        activity could/did cause to/upon the victim.\n\n                 ....\n\nemotional distress.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-315(a)(3). As relevant to this case, aggravated stalking\nmay be established when a person commits the offense of stalking and “[a]t the time of the offense, [the\nperson] was prohibited from making contact with the victim under an . . . order of protection . . . and the\nperson knowingly violates the . . . order.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-315(c)(1)(E).\n\n        2\n            In Counterman v. Colorado, the Supreme Court analyzed Colorado’s stalking statute that made\nit unlawful to “[r]epeatedly . . . make[ ] any form of communication with another person’ in “a manner that\nwould cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress and does cause that person . . . to suffer\nserious emotional distress.” Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-3-602(1)(c). The Court held that, in a criminal\nprosecution, the First Amendment requires some proof of a defendant’s subjective understanding of his\nstatements’ threatening nature and that a recklessness mens rea is sufficient to establish that understanding.\nCounterman, 680 U.S. at 78-82.\n\n        The Defendant noted in his motion to dismiss that the legislature amended the statute in 2024 by\nrevising the definition of harassment to include a subjective mens rea that a defendant act “with reckless\ndisregard for whether the victim will suffer emotional distress as a result of the conduct.” Tenn. Code\nAnn. § 39-17-315(a)(3)(A)(ii) (2024).\n\n        3\n           As will be further discussed, the trial court entered an order on December 3, 2024, denying the\nmotion to dismiss. Later, on February 14, 2025, the trial court entered a superseding order that\nincorporated the findings and conclusions from the December 3, 2024 order.\n                                                     -2-\n\f               The Defendant is correct in his assertion that the Colorado statute and\n        [] § 39-17-315 bear a number of striking similarities. His argument,\n        however, omits the critical distinctions that allow the Tennessee statute to\n        survive constitutional scrutiny post[-]Counterman. In this State in order to\n        sustain a stalking prosecution the State must prove not only whether or not a\n        reasonable person would be impacted by a defendant’s activity, but must also\n        prove that the defendant’s action(s) were willful and harassing.\n\n         On February 25, 2025, the Defendant filed a motion in the trial court seeking\ninterlocutory review. Tenn. R. App. P. 9(b). As grounds, the Defendant argued that\ninterlocutory review was necessary to prevent irreparable injury, see id. 9(a)(1), in that\nproceeding to trial would result in (1) a negative and significant financial impact associated\nwith his traveling from out of state to defend himself at trial, (2) an exacerbation of his\n“significant mental health conditions,” and (3) the risk of incarceration if convicted at\ntrial. 4 The Defendant also argued that interlocutory review would prevent needless,\nexpensive, and protracted litigation and would further the development of a uniform body\nof law. See id. 9(a)(2) and (3).\n\n        On August 22, 2025, the trial court granted the Defendant’s motion for interlocutory\nreview. The trial court determined that interlocutory review was necessary to prevent\nirreparable injury to the Defendant with consideration of the Defendant’s residing in Texas\nand suffering from extensive mental health conditions. Id. 9(a)(1). The trial court also\nfound that interlocutory appeal would prevent needless, expensive, and protracted\nlitigation because, if the court had erred in denying the motion to dismiss, a trial would be\navoided. Id. 9(a)(2). Finally, the trial court found that “appellate interpretation is needed\nto develop a uniform body of law to clarify whether the Tennessee stalking statute in place\nat the time of the Defendant’s presentment violates First Amendment protections.” Id.\n9(a)(3). In so doing, the trial court certified the following issue for review:\n\n    Whether Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-315 (2023) criminalize[s]\n    protected speech in violation of the First Amendment of the United States\n    Constitution and [the Supreme Court’s holding in] Counterman v. Colorado,\n    600 U.S. 66 (2023)?\n\nThe Defendant has filed an application from the trial court’s order granting interlocutory\nreview. Tenn. R. App. P. 9(c). The State has filed a timely answer in opposition to the\n        4\n             Only for the limited purpose of establishing a basis for interlocutory review, the parties\nstipulated that expert testimony and medical records would establish that the Defendant has been diagnosed\nwith schizoaffective disorder and that “continued litigation in this case would negatively impact the\nDefendant and his mental health.”\n                                                  -3-\n\fapplication. The application and attachments thereto are sufficient for this court’s review.\nId. 9(a).\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       Rule 9(a) provides the following criteria for determining whether to grant\ninterlocutory appeal:\n\n       (1)    the need to prevent irreparable injury, giving consideration to the\n       severity of the potential injury, the probability of its occurrence, and the\n       probability that review upon entry of final judgment will be ineffective;\n\n       (2)    the need to prevent needless, expensive, and protracted litigation,\n       giving consideration to whether the challenged order would be a basis for\n       reversal upon entry of a final judgment, the probability of reversal, and\n       whether an interlocutory appeal will result in a net reduction in the duration\n       and expense of the litigation if the challenged order is reversed; and\n\n       (3)    the need to develop a uniform body of law, giving consideration to the\n       existence of inconsistent orders of other courts and whether the question\n       presented by the challenged order will not otherwise be reviewable upon\n       entry of final judgment.\n\nId. 9(a)(1)-(3).\n\n       “An interlocutory appeal is an exception to the general rule that requires a final\njudgment before a party may appeal as of right.” State v. Gilley, 173 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tenn.\n2005). To that end, the Tennessee Supreme Court has stated repeatedly that\n“interlocutory appeals to review pretrial orders or rulings, i.e., those entered before a final\njudgment, are ‘disfavored,’ particularly in criminal cases.” Id.; see also State v. Meeks,\n262 S.W.3d 710, 720 (Tenn. 2008); State v. McKim, 215 S.W.3d 781, 790 (Tenn. 2007);\nState v. Scarborough, 201 S.W.3d 607, 612 n.2 (Tenn. 2006); Reid v. State, 197 S.W.3d\n694, 699 (Tenn. 2006); State v. Williams, 193 S.W.3d 502, 506 (Tenn. 2006). “[T]hus, it\nis incumbent on the party seeking the appeal . . . to satisfy the court or courts that there are\nappropriate grounds for an interlocutory appeal.” Meeks, 262 S.W.3d at 720.\n\n       In the application before the court, the Defendant maintains the same arguments in\nfavor of interlocutory review as he presented in the trial court: to prevent irreparable injury,\nprevent needless litigation, and develop a uniform body of law. Tenn. R. App. P. 9(a)(1),\n(2), and (3). In response, the State urges this court to deny the Defendant’s application,\narguing that the Defendant failed to file a timely motion for interlocutory review from the\n                                             -4-\n\ftrial court’s December 3, 2024 order denying the motion to dismiss. On the merits of the\napplication, the State argues that the application for interlocutory appeal should be denied\nbecause “the constitutional issue presented can and should only be reviewed by this Court\nafter any final judgment of conviction” and that “[d]eferring review until necessary after\nfinal judgment will not cause irrevocable harm and will instead prevent needless,\nexpensive, and protracted litigation.”\n\n        As to the State’s procedural argument, the court observes that the trial court’s\nFebruary 14, 2024 superseding order indicates that it was entered “with the specific intent\nto permit the defendant to timely file a request seeking interlocutory review.” Tennessee\nRule of Appellate Procedure 9(b) states that “[t]he party seeking the appeal must file and\nserve a motion requesting such relief within 30 days after the date of entry of the order\nappealed from.” Id. 9(b). This court in no way condones the use of a superseding order\nto “reset” the time for filing a motion for interlocutory review. We also note, however, that\nthe failure to timely file a motion seeking interlocutory review is not always fatal to this\ncourt’s consideration of an application because the timely filing requirement of Rule\n9(b)—as well as the timely filing requirement of Rule 9(c) relative to an application to this\ncourt—may be suspended for good cause in this court’s discretion. Id. 2. That said, the\nDefendant has not responded to the State’s procedural argument asking this court to\nsuspend the timely filing requirements.\n\n       Regardless, we determine that good cause cannot be established to suspend the\ntimely filing requirements of Rule 9 when, as in this case, the Defendant failed to establish\nthe necessity for interlocutory review. First, any issue surrounding the trial court’s denial\nof the Defendant’s motion to dismiss the presentment can be easily reviewed on direct\nappeal via either a certified question following a guilty plea or following a conviction at\ntrial. See, e.g., State v. McMillan, No. E2025-00091-CCA-R9-CO (Tenn. Crim. App.\nFeb. 28, 2025) (Order) (application for interlocutory appeal denied where Defendant\nchallenged the trial court’s denial of a motion to dismiss indictment in which the Defendant\nargued the felon in possession of a firearm statute violates his Second Amendment rights as\napplied to him). Likewise, we agree with the State that an interlocutory appeal would\nextend the litigation in this case rather than prevent needless litigation. Further, the\nDefendant will not suffer irreparable harm without interlocutory review. The inherent\nnegative impact of proceeding to trial—whether psychological or financial—exists in any\ncriminal prosecution. Granting interlocutory review on this basis would negate the\nlong-standing principle that interlocutory appeals are “disfavored” in criminal cases.\nGilley, 173 S.W.3d at 5. Moreover, there is no need to develop a uniform body of law as\nthis case presents an issue of first impression for Tennessee courts.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\f                                    CONCLUSION\n\n        Accordingly, the Defendant’s application for permission to appeal pursuant to Rule\n9 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure is DENIED. The costs associated with this\nproceeding are taxed to the Defendant, Zachary Thomas Hays, for which let execution\nissue, if necessary.\n\n                                                 JUDGE STEVEN W.

Code Ann. § 39-17-315</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(3). As relevant to this case, aggravated stalking\nmay be established when a person commits the offense of stalking and “[a]t the time of the offense, [the\nperson] was prohibited from making contact with the victim under an . . . order of protection . . . and the\nperson knowingly violates the . . . order.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-315</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c)(1)(E).\n\n        2\n            In Counterman v. Colorado, the Supreme Court analyzed Colorado’s stalking statute that made\nit unlawful to “[r]epeatedly . . . make[ ] any form of communication with another person’ in “a manner that\nwould cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress and does cause that person . . . to suffer\nserious emotional distress.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-3-602</span><pre class=\"inline\">(1)(c). The Court held that, in a criminal\nprosecution, the First Amendment requires some proof of a defendant’s subjective understanding of his\nstatements’ threatening nature and that a recklessness mens rea is sufficient to establish that understanding.\nCounterman, 680 U.S. at 78-82.\n\n        The Defendant noted in his motion to dismiss that the legislature amended the statute in 2024 by\nrevising the definition of harassment to include a subjective mens rea that a defendant act “with reckless\ndisregard for whether the victim will suffer emotional distress as a result of the conduct.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code\nAnn. § 39-17-315</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(3)(A)(ii) (2024).\n\n        3\n           As will be further discussed, the trial court entered an order on December 3, 2024, denying the\nmotion to dismiss. Later, on February 14, 2025, the trial court entered a superseding order that\nincorporated the findings and conclusions from the December 3, 2024 order.\n                                                     -2-\n\f               The Defendant is correct in his assertion that the Colorado statute and\n        [] § 39-17-315 bear a number of striking similarities. His argument,\n        however, omits the critical distinctions that allow the Tennessee statute to\n        survive constitutional scrutiny post[-]Counterman. In this State in order to\n        sustain a stalking prosecution the State must prove not only whether or not a\n        reasonable person would be impacted by a defendant’s activity, but must also\n        prove that the defendant’s action(s) were willful and harassing.\n\n         On February 25, 2025, the Defendant filed a motion in the trial court seeking\ninterlocutory review. Tenn. R. App. P. 9(b). As grounds, the Defendant argued that\ninterlocutory review was necessary to prevent irreparable injury, see id. 9(a)(1), in that\nproceeding to trial would result in (1) a negative and significant financial impact associated\nwith his traveling from out of state to defend himself at trial, (2) an exacerbation of his\n“significant mental health conditions,” and (3) the risk of incarceration if convicted at\ntrial. 4 The Defendant also argued that interlocutory review would prevent needless,\nexpensive, and protracted litigation and would further the development of a uniform body\nof law. See id. 9(a)(2) and (3).\n\n        On August 22, 2025, the trial court granted the Defendant’s motion for interlocutory\nreview. The trial court determined that interlocutory review was necessary to prevent\nirreparable injury to the Defendant with consideration of the Defendant’s residing in Texas\nand suffering from extensive mental health conditions. Id. 9(a)(1). The trial court also\nfound that interlocutory appeal would prevent needless, expensive, and protracted\nlitigation because, if the court had erred in denying the motion to dismiss, a trial would be\navoided. Id. 9(a)(2). Finally, the trial court found that “appellate interpretation is needed\nto develop a uniform body of law to clarify whether the Tennessee stalking statute in place\nat the time of the Defendant’s presentment violates First Amendment protections.” Id.\n9(a)(3). In so doing, the trial court certified the following issue for review:\n\n    Whether Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-315 (2023) criminalize[s]\n    protected speech in violation of the First Amendment of the United States\n    Constitution and [the Supreme Court’s holding in] Counterman v.

Tenn. R. App. P. 9(a)(1),\n(2), and (3). In response, the State urges this court to deny the Defendant’s application,\narguing that the Defendant failed to file a timely motion for interlocutory review from the\n                                             -4-\n\ftrial court’s December 3, 2024 order denying the motion to dismiss. On the merits of the\napplication, the State argues that the application for interlocutory appeal should be denied\nbecause “the constitutional issue presented can and should only be reviewed by this Court\nafter any final judgment of conviction” and that “[d]eferring review until necessary after\nfinal judgment will not cause irrevocable harm and will instead prevent needless,\nexpensive, and protracted litigation.”\n\n        As to the State’s procedural argument, the court observes that the trial court’s\nFebruary 14, 2024 superseding order indicates that it was entered “with the specific intent\nto permit the defendant to timely file a request seeking interlocutory review.” Tennessee\nRule of Appellate Procedure 9(b) states that “[t]he party seeking the appeal must file and\nserve a motion requesting such relief within 30 days after the date of entry of the order\nappealed from.” Id. 9(b). This court in no way condones the use of a superseding order\nto “reset” the time for filing a motion for interlocutory review. We also note, however, that\nthe failure to timely file a motion seeking interlocutory review is not always fatal to this\ncourt’s consideration of an application because the timely filing requirement of Rule\n9(b)—as well as the timely filing requirement of Rule 9(c) relative to an application to this\ncourt—may be suspended for good cause in this court’s discretion. Id. 2. That said, the\nDefendant has not responded to the State’s procedural argument asking this court to\nsuspend the timely filing requirements.\n\n       Regardless, we determine that good cause cannot be established to suspend the\ntimely filing requirements of Rule 9 when, as in this case, the Defendant failed to establish\nthe necessity for interlocutory review. First, any issue surrounding the trial court’s denial\nof the Defendant’s motion to dismiss the presentment can be easily reviewed on direct\nappeal via either a certified question following a guilty plea or following a conviction at\ntrial. See, e.g., State v. McMillan, No. E2025-00091-CCA-R9-CO (Tenn. Crim. App.\nFeb. 28, 2025) (Order) (application for interlocutory appeal denied where Defendant\nchallenged the trial court’s denial of a motion to dismiss indictment in which the Defendant\nargued the felon in possession of a firearm statute violates his Second Amendment rights as\napplied to him). Likewise, we agree with the State that an interlocutory appeal would\nextend the litigation in this case rather than prevent needless litigation. Further, the\nDefendant will not suffer irreparable harm without interlocutory review. The inherent\nnegative impact of proceeding to trial—whether psychological or financial—exists in any\ncriminal prosecution. Granting interlocutory review on this basis would negate the\nlong-standing principle that interlocutory appeals are “disfavored” in criminal cases.\nGilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058205\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058205/state-v-gilley/#5\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v.

(the “Child”). Victoria H. (“Mother”) and Mark M. (“Father”), who are not\n\n\n        1\n         This Court’s policy is to abbreviate the last names of children and other parties in cases involving\ntermination of parental rights to protect their privacy and identities.\n\fmarried, had the Child in February of 2021. The Child lived with Mother,2 Father, and\nMother’s other two children, the Child’s half-siblings, until the Tennessee Department of\nChildren’s Services (“DCS”) removed all three children in July of 2022. According to the\nproof at trial, the incident giving rise to the Child’s removal occurred on July 11, 2022,\nwhen Mother and Father were in their vehicle together with the Child and began arguing.\nDuring this argument, Father sprayed paint3 in Mother’s face and told Mother he was going\nto have sexual relations with Mother’s friends. Father then exited the car, and Mother\nstepped on the accelerator and ran over Father with the vehicle. Mother left the scene, and\npolice arrested her shortly thereafter. Mother was charged with aggravated assault, and\nDCS removed the Child and his siblings from the parents’ custody. Gennie C. filed a\npetition seeking temporary custody of the Child, which the Juvenile Court for Bradley\nCounty granted following a hearing on July 26, 2022. The Child’s half-sister, Zariah, was\nplaced with Gennie C.’s sister.4\n\n       The Child remained in Gennie C.’s custody following his removal from Father. At\nthe time of the Child’s removal, Father was on probation for aggravated burglary, although\nthe details of that criminal matter are not in the record. Father testified that he pled guilty\nto the burglary charge in April of 2022 and received six years of supervised probation.\nFollowing the Child’s removal in 2022, Father and Mother remained in an\non-again-off-again relationship and intermittently resided together in various places.\nFather testified that he was briefly incarcerated in Bledsoe County in early 2023. He\ncompleted a thirty-day rehabilitation program in September 2023 but later relapsed and\nbegan smoking marijuana again. Father has seen the Child once, very briefly, since DCS\nremoved him.5 Father was arrested again in February of 2024 after being pulled over in\nMcMinn County; the officers found Father to be in possession of marijuana,\nmethamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia. Consequently, at the time of trial in March of\n2024, Father was incarcerated for violating the terms of his probation and did not know his\nrelease date. He testified that he might have to “flatten” his full sentence.\n\n\n\n        2\n         Mother’s parental rights have been terminated, and she is not participating in the present appeal.\nMother is mentioned only for context.\n        3\n            Father testified that he had spray paint in the car because he has a habit of doing graffiti around\ntown.\n        4\n          Gennie C.’s nephew, Caleb M., also shares a child, Jessalin M., with Mother. That child is in\nCaleb M.’s custody. Accordingly, Gennie C. is the aunt of the Child’s half-sibling and has known Mother\nand Father for several years. While Remi M. is the only child at issue in this appeal, Mother’s rights to\nboth Remi and Zariah were at issue in the trial court; thus, Zariah is also mentioned for context. This is also\nwhy the trial court’s orders mention “children” as opposed to only the Child.\n        5\n         The parties all reference a no-contact order between Father and the Child. However, it is unclear\nfrom the record what precipitated that order, and the order itself is not in the record.\n                                                      -2-\n\f        Gennie C. and her husband, John C. (hereinafter, “Petitioners”), filed their petition\nto terminate both parents’ rights on May 12, 2023, in the Circuit Court for Bradley County\n(the “trial court”). As to Father, Petitioners alleged five statutory grounds for termination:\nfailure to support, failure to visit, persistent conditions, failure to manifest an ability and\nwillingness to assume custody of the Child, and failure to establish paternity. Father\nanswered the petition, pro se, on June 20, 2023.\n\n        The trial court held a final hearing on March 8, 2024, at which Mother, Father,\nPetitioners, Father’s mother, and Zariah’s custodian all testified. The bulk of the proof at\ntrial centered on Mother and her history of substance abuse, as well as the domestic incident\nleading to her children’s removal by DCS. Mother and Father both testified about having\na toxic relationship with one another and detailed instances of domestic violence. Mother\ntestified that she intentionally hit Father with her car on July 11, 2022. For his part, Father\ndetailed an incident that occurred in 2021:\n\n       A. Yeah. In 2021 we were getting kind of lively with each other in the\n       driveway and I had grabbed her by her hair and was screaming at her, F-U,\n       F-U, and beating her head on the window in front of the kids in the backseat\n       of the car.\n\n       When I took [the Child] out of the backseat and put him in the house I was\n       coming back out to get the other kids out of the car so that we could finish\n       our little discrepancy and she was already gone.\n\n       And then the police showed up about four minutes later, if that, and I just\n       brought [the Child] out of the house and handed him to the police and then\n       they kind of threw me in the back of the car. She had dropped those charges.\n\n       For their part, Petitioners testified that the Child is doing well in their care, although\nhe was slightly delayed upon first coming into their home. The Child spends a lot of time\nwith his half-sister, Zariah, who lives next door to Petitioners with Gennie C.’s sister. The\nChild also has a relationship with his other half-sister, Jessalin, who lives with her father\nnearby. The Child has visitation with his paternal grandmother once a week on Fridays,\nand the grandmother drives from Lula, Georgia to see the Child. According to the\ngrandmother, she has come to have a good relationship with Petitioners, and they both love\nthe Child. Petitioners testified that the Child has a bonded relationship with their two\nbiological children who also reside in the home with the Child. Petitioners testified that\nthey wish to adopt the Child.\n\n       The trial court took the case under advisement and entered its final written order on\nMay 1, 2024. The trial court found that Petitioners failed to satisfy their burden of proof\nas to several of the alleged statutory grounds but ultimately concluded that Petitioners\nproved, by clear and convincing evidence, that Father failed to manifest an ability and\n                                              -3-\n\fwillingness to assume custody of the Child. The trial court also found that terminating\nFather’s parental rights was in the Child’s best interests. Father appeals to this Court.\n\n                                           ISSUES\n\n       I.     Whether the trial court erred in terminating Father’s parental rights pursuant\n              to Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-1-113(g)(14).\n\n       II.    Whether the trial court correctly concluded that terminating Father’s parental\n              rights is in the Child’s best interests.\n\n       Petitioners raise no additional issues in their posture as appellees.\n\n                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        “A person seeking to terminate parental rights must prove both the existence of one\nof the statutory grounds for termination and that termination is in the child’s best interest.”\nIn re Jacobe M.J., 434 S.W.3d 565, 568 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2013) (citing Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-1-113(c)). “Because of the profound consequences of a decision to terminate parental\nrights, a petitioner must prove both elements of termination by clear and convincing\nevidence.” In re Markus E., 671 S.W.3d 437, 456 (Tenn. 2023). This heightened burden\n“minimizes the risk of unnecessary or erroneous governmental interference with\nfundamental parental rights” and “enables the fact-finder to form a firm belief or conviction\nregarding the truth of the facts[.]” In re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507, 522 (Tenn. 2016)\n(citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769 (1982); In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d 586,\n596 (Tenn. 2010)). “The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard ensures that the facts are\nestablished as highly probable, rather than as simply more probable than not.” Id. (citing\nIn re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 861 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).\n\n      As our Supreme Court recently explained, we employ a two-step process in\nreviewing termination cases:\n\n       To review trial court decisions, appellate courts use a [] two-step process, to\n       accommodate both Rule 13(d) of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate\n       Procedure and the statutory clear and convincing standard. First, appellate\n       courts review each of the trial court’s specific factual findings de novo under\n       Rule 13(d), presuming each finding to be correct unless the evidence\n       preponderates against it. In re Taylor B.W., 397 S.W.3d 105, 112 (Tenn.\n       2013); In re Justice A.F., [No. W2011-02520-COA-R3-PT,] 2012 WL\n       4340709, at *7 [(Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 24, 2012)]. When a trial court’s factual\n       finding is based on its assessment of a witness’s credibility, appellate courts\n       afford great weight to that determination and will not reverse it absent clear\n       evidence to the contrary. Jones v. Garrett, 92 S.W.3d 835, 838 (Tenn. 2002);\n                                             -4-\n\f        In re Justice A.F., 2012 WL 4340709, at *7 (citing In re M.L.D., 182 S.W.3d\n        890, 894 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).\n\n        Second, appellate courts determine whether the combination of all of the\n        individual underlying facts, in the aggregate, constitutes clear and convincing\n        evidence. In re Taylor B.W., 397 S.W.3d at 112; In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d\n        838, 861 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); In re Justice A.F., 2012 WL 4340709, at *7.\n        Whether the aggregate of the individual facts, either as found by the trial\n        court or supported by a preponderance of the evidence, amounts to clear and\n        convincing evidence is a question of law, subject to de novo review with no\n        presumption of correctness. See In re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d 387, 393 (Tenn.\n        2009); see also In re Samaria S., 347 S.W.3d 188, 200 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2011).\n        As usual, the appellate court reviews all other conclusions of law de novo\n        with no presumption of correctness. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d [240,] 246\n        [(Tenn. 2010)].\n\nIn re Markus E., 671 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n                                                DISCUSSION\n\nGrounds for termination\n\n        a. Failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody\n\n      The only statutory ground for termination found by the trial court was failure to\nmanifest an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of or financial\nresponsibility for the Child. This ground applies when\n\n        [a] parent . . . has failed to manifest, by act or omission, an ability and\n        willingness to personally assume legal and physical custody or financial\n        responsibility of the child, and placing the child in the person’s legal and\n        physical custody would pose a risk of substantial harm to the physical or\n        psychological welfare of the child[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(g)(14).6 This ground requires clear and convincing proof of\ntwo elements. In re Neveah M., 614 S.W.3d 659, 674 (Tenn. 2020). The petitioner must\nfirst prove that the parent has failed to manifest an ability and willingness to personally\nassume legal and physical custody or financial responsibility of the child. Id. The\npetitioner must then prove that placing the child in the parent’s custody poses “a risk of\nsubstantial harm to the physical or psychological welfare of the child.” Id. The statute\n\n        6\n          In termination cases, we apply the version of the statute in effect at the time the petition was filed.\nSee In re Braxton M., 531 S.W.3d 708, 732 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2017).\n                                                      -5-\n\frequires “a parent . . . to manifest both an ability and willingness to personally assume legal\nand physical custody or financial responsibility for the child.” Id. at 677. Therefore, if a\nparty seeking termination of parental rights establishes that a parent or guardian “failed to\nmanifest either ability or willingness, then the first prong of the statute is satisfied.” Id.\n\n       Regarding the second statutory prong,\n\n       [t]he courts have not undertaken to define the circumstances that pose a risk\n       of substantial harm to a child. These circumstances are not amenable to\n       precise definition because of the variability of human conduct. However, the\n       use of the modifier “substantial” indicates two things. First, it connotes a real\n       hazard or danger that is not minor, trivial, or insignificant. Second, it\n       indicates that the harm must be more than a theoretical possibility. While the\n       harm need not be inevitable, it must be sufficiently probable to prompt a\n       reasonable person to believe that the harm will occur more likely than not.\n\nIn re Virgil W., No. E2018-00091-COA-R3-PT, 2018 WL 4931470, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nOct. 11, 2018) (quoting Ray v. Ray, 83 S.W.3d 726, 732 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)).\n\n       As relevant,7 the trial court in the present case found as follows regarding this\nstatutory ground:\n\n       The court finds that Mother and Father have failed to manifest both an\n       “ability” and “willingness” to personally assume legal and physical custody\n       or financial responsibility of the children. “When evaluating ability, [courts]\n       focus on the parent’s lifestyle and circumstances.” In re Kyland F., 2020 WL\n       957647 at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 27, 2020). (Citations omitted).\n\n       *         *       *\n\n       As to Father, he has not financially supported the minor child. Father has\n       only visited with the minor child one time since the July 11, 2022 removal.\n       He has another minor child with [another woman] that he has not seen since\n       2021. He has not had a driver’s license since he was 17, he does not have a\n       vehicle, and he has no place to live. According to Father, he is “homeless on\n       the streets.” Father also has an extensive criminal history as well as a history\n       of illegal drug use dating back to when he was 17 years old. He has been\n       incarcerated for a majority of the child’s life. After the July 11, 2022 removal,\n       Father failed a drug test and went back to jail. Between the time of removal\n       and October 26, 2022, Father spent 70 days in jail. Father went back into jail\n       on October 26, 2022 and did not get released until May 30, 2023 after the\n\n       7\n           Some findings relating exclusively to Mother are omitted for brevity.\n                                                    -6-\n\fPetitions were filed. On or about August 15, 2023, Father went to a\nrehabilitation facility through September 14, 2023. While there, he was\nprescribed medications for mental disorders. Thereafter, he smoked\n[m]arijuana and failed a drug test. Then, on or about February 6, 2024, Father\nwas arrested for possession of [m]ethamphetamine, possession of\n[m]arijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Father pled guilty to\npossession of drug paraphernalia, and the 2 other charges were dismissed.\nThis was a violation of his probation as related to his previous [a]ggravated\n[b]urglary conviction. Father has been incarcerated since the February 6,\n2024 arrest. Father does not know if his 6 year [a]ggravated [b]urglary\nsentence will be flattened requiring him to serve all of his sentence. Per\nFather, the very soonest he could care for the minor children is in a year.\nFather also suffers from mental instability.\n\n         The court also finds that placing the minor child in Mother’s and\nFather’s legal and physical care and/or custody would pose a risk of\nsubstantial harm to the physical or psychological welfare of the children.\n“The use of the modifier ‘substantial’ indicates two things. First, it connotes\na real hazard or danger that is not minor, trivial, or insignificant. Second, it\nindicates that the harm must be more than a theoretical possibility. While the\nharm need not be inevitable, it must be sufficiently probable to prompt a\nreasonable person to believe that the harm will occur more likely than not[].”\nIn re Braelyn S., 2020 WL 420008 at *17 (quoting In re Maya R., 2018 WL\n1629930 (Tenn. Ct App. April 4, 2018)). In addition to the above, and yet\nagain, Mother and Father have a history of criminal illegal drug abuse.\nMother and Father continue to fail drug tests. There is a risk to the minor\nchildren that they would be exposed to illegal drugs while in their care. One\nof the minor children has tested positive for drugs. On July 11, 2022, Father,\nMother and Remi were in a vehicle at which time Mother and Father began\nto argue. This led to Father spraying paint on Mother’s face and Mother\nrunning over Father in a vehicle, after which time, Father had to be treated at\na local hospital for [a] broken leg. . . . [B]ased on Father’s history, there [is]\nno indication to this court that when Father is eventually released [from]\nincarceration, Father is capable of maintaining stable employment, income,\nhousing, transportation and sobriety. Simply put, neither Mother nor Father\nare fit to parent. As such, the court finds that based upon the facts in this case,\nplacing the children in Mother’s and Father’s care and custody would pose a\nrisk of substantial harm to the physical and/or psychological welfare of the\nyoung children. The court further finds that the risk of harm to the minor\nchildren is “substantial”, meaning the risk is real and not merely minor,\ntrivial, insignificant or a theoretical possibility.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f        Having reviewed the record, the evidence preponderates in favor of the trial court’s\nfactual findings regarding Father and section 36-1-113(g)(14). We agree that Father is not\nfit to parent the Child and that Father failed to manifest both an ability and willingness to\nparent. Father has been in and out of jail for the Child’s entire life and does not know when\nhe will be released. Father admitted at trial that he would have no place to live and no\nmeans with which to support the Child upon his release. Father’s extensive criminal history\nraises serious doubt regarding his “actual willingness to assume custody or financial\nresponsibility for the [C]hild.” In re Kaylene J., No. E2019-02122-COA-R3-PT, 2021 WL\n2135954, at *17 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 26, 2021); see also In re Bobby B., No.\nE2024-00730-COA-R3-PT, 2024 WL 4458390, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 10, 2024)\n(mother failed to manifest ability and willingness where she “continued with her criminal\nactivity and drug abuse[,]” and “these decisions [ ] resulted in the possibility of an\neight-year prison sentence for the felony criminal charges pending against her”); In re\nPaisley J., No. W2022-01059-COA-R3-PT, 2023 WL 4417390, at *11 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nJuly 10, 2023) (“Because Father demonstrated a lifestyle fraught with financial instability,\npersistent illegal drug use, cycles of incarceration, and repeated criminal activity . . . Father\nfailed to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody of or financial responsibility\nfor the Children.”).\n\n        For largely the same reasons, we also conclude that Petitioners proved the second\nprong of section 36-1-113(g)(14) by clear and convincing evidence. Given the long period\nof time the Child has been in Petitioners’ custody, and Father’s precarious, transient\nlifestyle, the Child would be at risk of substantial harm, both physical and psychological,\nif returned to Father’s custody. Particularly disturbing is Father’s flippant attitude about\ndrug abuse and domestic violence within his family. Father described smashing Mother’s\nhead into a car window while screaming “F-U” at her in front of the children as “getting\nlively” and a “little discrepancy.” Father indicated no remorse for this type of behavior at\ntrial, and we have great concern about returning the Child to these circumstances.\n\n       Consequently, the trial court correctly concluded that Petitioners proved this\nstatutory ground by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nBest interests\n\n       In addition to proving at least one statutory ground for termination, petitioners in a\ntermination case must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination serves the\nchild’s best interests. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(c). Indeed, “a finding of unfitness does\nnot necessarily require that the parent’s rights be terminated.” In re Marr, 194 S.W.3d\n490, 498 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) (citing White v. Moody, 171 S.W.3d 187, 193 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2004)). Our termination statutes recognize that “[n]ot all parental misconduct is\nirredeemable” and that “terminating an unfit parent’s parental rights is not always in the\nchild’s best interests.” Id. As such, the focus of the best interests analysis is not the parent\nbut rather the child. Id.; see also White, 171 S.W.3d at 194 (“[A] child’s best interests must\n                                              -8-\n\fbe viewed from the child’s, rather than the parent’s, perspective.”). Further, “the prompt\nand permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is presumed to be in the child’s\nbest interest.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(i)(2).\n\n      When determining whether termination is in a child’s best interests, we refer to\ntwenty non-exclusive factors found at Tennessee Code Annotated section\n36-1-113(i)(1)(A)-(T). In this case, the trial court applied the correct statutory factors and\nengaged in a thorough analysis in its final order:\n\n  (A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the child’s\n      critical need for stability and continuity of placement throughout the\n      child’s minority.\n\n       [These] minor children have a critical need for stability and continuity of\n       placement throughout the children’s minority. The minor children have been\n       in the homes of the Petitioners since on or about July 11, 2022. Mother and\n       Father have failed to address their illegal drug use and provide a stable home\n       environment for the children that is drug free. Father is still incarcerated, and\n       he does not know when he will be released. Mother and Father have failed to\n       demonstrate any understanding of the children’s need for stability and\n       continuity. The Court finds that Mother and Father have not effectively\n       bonded with the minor children. The minor children are now thriving in the\n       homes of the Petitioners, and they live next to each other. The minor children\n       are now in stable, loving, and healthy environments with the Petitioners. As\n       these young children age, their needs will only increase. Termination of the\n       Respondents’ parental rights will increase the minor children’s stability and\n       allow the children to have stable placements throughout their lives.\n\n  (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to\n      have on the child’s emotional, psychological, and medical condition.\n\n       The young minor children have lived with the Petitioners since on or about\n       July 11, 2022. Based upon their young age, the Petitioners are the individuals\n       who have provided the most consistent emotional, psychological, and\n       medical support for these children. Neither Mother nor Father have\n       demonstrated that they can provide a stable environment that would promote\n       the children’s emotional, psychological and/or medical needs. The court\n       finds that a change of caregivers would dramatically and adversely [a]ffect\n       the children’s best interests. The Petitioners have provided positive, loving\n       and stable physical environments and have been supportive of the children’s\n       emotional, psychological, and/or medical needs. The minor children have\n       improved since going into the Petitioners’ care. As the children age, their\n       needs will only increase. This includes educational needs and mature\n                                             -9-\n\f   emotional needs. Mother and Father simply lack the ability and stability to\n   [e]nsure that the children’s ongoing and growing needs will be met in their\n   care.\n\n(C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability in\n    meeting the child’s basic material, educational, housing, and safety\n    needs.\n\n   Mother and Father have failed to demonstrate an ability to consistently\n   provide for the children’s material, housing, and safety needs. Mother and\n   Father continue to use illegal drugs and fail drug tests. Mother and Father\n   have not adequately addressed their drug abuse issues. Father has an\n   extensive criminal history, and he was arrested for drug related offenses just\n   prior to trial. Mother and Father have not shown employment, housing and\n   income stability. Father is incarcerated and does not know when he will be\n   released. Mother’s and Father’s economic circumstances remain unstable\n   and they have not demonstrated an ability to consistently provide for their\n   own needs, much less material, housing, and safety needs of the children.\n   The Court finds that while the children are now young, the needs of the\n   children will only increase as the children age and begin their formal\n   education. Finally, Mother and Father have a toxic relationship and history\n   of abuse in front of the minor children.\n\n(D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy parental\n    attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable expectation that\n    the parent can create such attachment.\n\n   The court finds that Mother and Father failed to offer proof at trial that they\n   have any parental attachment with the children, much less a secure and\n   healthy parental attachment. Based on the proof, the court finds that there is\n   not a reasonable expectation that Mother and/or Father can create such an\n   attachment for the reasons set forth herein including their ongoing drug use\n   as evidenced by the failed drug tests. . . . Father has only seen [the Child] one\n   time since the July 11, 2022 removal.\n\n(E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact\n    with the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate a\n    positive relationship with the child.\n\n   The court finds that Mother and Father have failed to maintain regular\n   visitation with the minor children. . . . Father . . . has basically had no\n   meaningful visitation with [the Child] due to his conduct, illegal drug use,\n   and ongoing incarceration. The court finds that Mother and Father have\n                                        - 10 -\n\f    displayed a “me first” attitude to the detriment of the minor children. Mother\n    and Father have prioritized their drug use and instability over cultivating a\n    positive relationship with the minor children.\n\n(F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent’s home.\n\n    The court did not hear much if any proof as related to this factor. However,\n    [the Child] was in the car when Father spray painted Mother’s face and she\n    ran Father over in a car. . . . [Father’s mother] also testified that Mother and\n    Father argued a lot in front of the minor children. Again, Mother and Father\n    have a toxic relationship and history of abuse in front of the minor children.\n\n(G) Whether the parent, parent’s home, or others in the parent’s household\n    trigger or exacerbate the child’s experience of trauma or post-traumatic\n    symptoms.\n\n    See the court’s analysis of factor (F).\n\n(H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment with\n    another person or persons in the absence of the parent.\n\n    The minor children have been consistently loved and cared for by the\n    Petitioners and their families. The children have greatly benefited from the\n    Petitioners’ love and support. The children have also developed a strong\n    bond with the Petitioners[] and their children. The minor children have\n    healthy attachments with Petitioners[] and their family.\n\n(I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships with persons\n    other than parents and caregivers, including biological or foster siblings,\n    and the likely impact of various available outcomes on these\n    relationships and the child’s access to information about the child’s\n    heritage.\n\n    The minor children have developed a positive and loving relationship with\n    the Petitioners[’] children and extended family. The Petitioners and minor\n    children live next door to each other, and the minor children are able to play,\n    eat meals and interact on a daily basis. The children are therefore being raised\n    together which is certainly in their best interest. The court finds that the\n    Petitioners seek to adopt, and through their positive relationship and\n    emotional support, the minor children will certainly have access to\n    information about their heritage and extended family.\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f(J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting adjustment of\n    circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and beneficial for\n    the child to be in the home of the parent, including consideration of\n    whether there is criminal activity in the home or by the parent, or the\n    use of alcohol, controlled substances, or controlled substance analogues\n    which may render the parent unable to consistently care for the child in\n    a safe and stable manner.\n\n    The court finds that Mother and Father have shown a lack of positive and/or\n    lasting adjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions that would make\n    it safe or beneficial for the children to be returned to their home. Mother and\n    Father continued to fail drug tests after the children were removed. Father\n    was arrested again for drug related offenses shortly before trial and remains\n    incarcerated.\n\n(K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available programs,\n    services, or community resources to assist in making a lasting\n    adjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions.\n\n    The Court finds that Mother and Father have failed to take advantage of\n    available programs, services, and/or community resources to assist them in\n    making a lasting adjustment of their circumstances and conduct. . . . [O]n or\n    about August 15, 2023, Father went to English Mountain Recovery through\n    September 14, 2023 for rehabilitation. Thereafter, Father smoked\n    [m]arijuana and failed a drug test. Then, as the trial date was approaching,\n    on or about February 6, 2024, Father was arrested for possession of\n    [m]ethamphetamine, possession of [m]arijuana, and possession of drug\n    paraphernalia. Father pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\n(L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent\n    in making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in the custody\n    of the department.\n\n    See factor (K) above.\n\n(M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in establishing\n    paternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or addressing the\n    circumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award of custody\n    unsafe and not in the child’s best interest.\n\n    See factors (J) and (K) above. Mother and Father have not demonstrated a\n    sense of urgency to regain custody and/or address the circumstances that lead\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\f    to removal. Mother and Father continue to fail drug tests, and Father’s\n    criminal conduct has continued.\n\n(N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or frequenting the\n    home of the parent, has shown brutality or physical, sexual, emotional,\n    or psychological abuse or neglect toward the child or any other child or\n    adult.\n\n    [The parents’] home environment was volatile, toxic and unhealthy as\n    confirmed by [Father’s mother]. The court finds that the relationship between\n    Mother and Father more likely than not detrimentally affected the minor\n    children.\n\n(O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for the child\n    or any other child.\n\n    The court finds that Mother and Father did not provide proof at trial that they\n    ever provided a safe and stable home for the children to reside. . . . Father\n    has another child that he has not seen since 2021. The Court finds that Mother\n    and Father have used illegal drugs at all times material to this case. The Court\n    finds that Mother and Father are unable to provide safe and stable care for\n    the children while abusing illegal drugs and/or under the influence of illegal\n    drugs. Again, Mother and Father have a toxic relationship and history of\n    abuse in front of the minor children.\n\n(P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the basic and\n    specific needs required for the child to thrive.\n\n    See factors (C) (J) and (O) above. The court finds that Mother and Father did\n    not offer proof at trial that they have ever demonstrated the ability or\n    understanding on how to provide for the basic needs and specific needs\n    required for the children to thrive. This is also evidenced by Mother’s and\n    Father’s continued drug use and Father’s continued criminal conduct. Mother\n    and Father do not understand and appreciate what they must do to meet the\n    children’s needs including remaining drug free. Father’s [criminal] conduct\n    and drug use has led to continued incarceration. The court finds that Mother\n    and Father chose illegal drug use as opposed to meeting the needs of the\n    minor children so as to enable the minor children to thrive.\n\n(Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and commitment to\n    creating and maintaining a home that meets the child’s basic and specific\n    needs and in which the child can thrive.\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\f    See factors (C) (J) (O) and (P) above. Additionally, Mother and Father have\n    not demonstrated the ability and commitment to create and maintain a home\n    that meets the minor children’s needs in which the children can thrive.\n\n(R) Whether the physical environment of the parent’s home is healthy and\n    safe for the child.\n\n    Father is incarcerated, and in his words, is “homeless on the streets.” . . .\n    Mother’s and Father’s home environment prior to removal was unstable and\n    volatile as set forth above. Mother’s and Father’s conduct reflects instability.\n\n(S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token financial\n    support for the child.\n\n    Mother and Father have failed to consistently provide more than token\n    financial support for the children. Neither Mother [nor] Father has paid direct\n    financial support for the benefit of the children since removal.\n\n(T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would be\n    detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n    effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n\n    The court finds that Mother’s and Father’s mental and/or emotional lack of\n    fitness would be detrimental to the minor children and would prevent Mother\n    and Father from consistently and effectively providing a safe and stable\n    environment in care of the minor children. Again, Mother and Father\n    continue to use illegal drugs and failed drug tests after removal. The court\n    finds that it would be detrimental to place the minor child back into the care\n    of Mother and Father.\n\n            Upon analyzing the factors set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated\n    §36-1-113(i)(1), the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n    termination of Mother’s and Father’s parental rights is in the best interests of\n    the minor children. The Guardian Ad Litem agrees. The termination of the\n    Respondents’ parental rights and subsequent adoption will promote stability\n    for the children, and allow the children to continue to live in stable and loving\n    home environments that they have enjoyed since July 11, 2022. For well over\n    a year while with the Petitioners, the minor children’s needs have been met\n    and they are thriving. The Petitioners, their children, and their family all have\n    a strong bond with the children. Mother and Father have not provided any\n    direct financial support. The children have a right to stable, safe and\n    continuity of placement, and these children have a right to be free from\n    neglect and to be nurtured by appropriate caregivers, or the Petitioners in this\n                                         - 14 -\n\f       case. Mother and Father cannot rest on their rights while ignoring the rights\n       of their children.\n\n        The trial court’s findings of fact are apt and supported by the record. Nearly, if not\nall, of the best interest factors favor terminating Father’s parental rights. Father is not fit\nto assume custody of the Child and has taken no meaningful steps toward being able to do\nso. Father essentially has no relationship with the Child as he has not seen him since 2022.\nIn the meantime, the Child is bonded with Petitioners’ family and is being raised with\nMother’s other children, the Child’s half-siblings. In light of all the foregoing, terminating\nFather’s parental rights is in the Child’s best interests. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\ncourt.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the Circuit Court for Bradley County is affirmed, and this case is\nremanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs on appeal are assessed to the\nappellant, Mark M., for which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     KRISTI M.

(the “Child”). Victoria H. (“Mother”) and Mark M. (“Father”), who are not\n\n\n        1\n         This Court’s policy is to abbreviate the last names of children and other parties in cases involving\ntermination of parental rights to protect their privacy and identities.\n\fmarried, had the Child in February of 2021. The Child lived with Mother,2 Father, and\nMother’s other two children, the Child’s half-siblings, until the Tennessee Department of\nChildren’s Services (“DCS”) removed all three children in July of 2022. According to the\nproof at trial, the incident giving rise to the Child’s removal occurred on July 11, 2022,\nwhen Mother and Father were in their vehicle together with the Child and began arguing.\nDuring this argument, Father sprayed paint3 in Mother’s face and told Mother he was going\nto have sexual relations with Mother’s friends. Father then exited the car, and Mother\nstepped on the accelerator and ran over Father with the vehicle. Mother left the scene, and\npolice arrested her shortly thereafter. Mother was charged with aggravated assault, and\nDCS removed the Child and his siblings from the parents’ custody. Gennie C. filed a\npetition seeking temporary custody of the Child, which the Juvenile Court for Bradley\nCounty granted following a hearing on July 26, 2022. The Child’s half-sister, Zariah, was\nplaced with Gennie C.’s sister.4\n\n       The Child remained in Gennie C.’s custody following his removal from Father. At\nthe time of the Child’s removal, Father was on probation for aggravated burglary, although\nthe details of that criminal matter are not in the record. Father testified that he pled guilty\nto the burglary charge in April of 2022 and received six years of supervised probation.\nFollowing the Child’s removal in 2022, Father and Mother remained in an\non-again-off-again relationship and intermittently resided together in various places.\nFather testified that he was briefly incarcerated in Bledsoe County in early 2023. He\ncompleted a thirty-day rehabilitation program in September 2023 but later relapsed and\nbegan smoking marijuana again. Father has seen the Child once, very briefly, since DCS\nremoved him.5 Father was arrested again in February of 2024 after being pulled over in\nMcMinn County; the officers found Father to be in possession of marijuana,\nmethamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia. Consequently, at the time of trial in March of\n2024, Father was incarcerated for violating the terms of his probation and did not know his\nrelease date. He testified that he might have to “flatten” his full sentence.\n\n\n\n        2\n         Mother’s parental rights have been terminated, and she is not participating in the present appeal.\nMother is mentioned only for context.\n        3\n            Father testified that he had spray paint in the car because he has a habit of doing graffiti around\ntown.\n        4\n          Gennie C.’s nephew, Caleb M., also shares a child, Jessalin M., with Mother. That child is in\nCaleb M.’s custody. Accordingly, Gennie C. is the aunt of the Child’s half-sibling and has known Mother\nand Father for several years. While Remi M. is the only child at issue in this appeal, Mother’s rights to\nboth Remi and Zariah were at issue in the trial court; thus, Zariah is also mentioned for context. This is also\nwhy the trial court’s orders mention “children” as opposed to only the Child.\n        5\n         The parties all reference a no-contact order between Father and the Child. However, it is unclear\nfrom the record what precipitated that order, and the order itself is not in the record.\n                                                      -2-\n\f        Gennie C. and her husband, John C. (hereinafter, “Petitioners”), filed their petition\nto terminate both parents’ rights on May 12, 2023, in the Circuit Court for Bradley County\n(the “trial court”). As to Father, Petitioners alleged five statutory grounds for termination:\nfailure to support, failure to visit, persistent conditions, failure to manifest an ability and\nwillingness to assume custody of the Child, and failure to establish paternity. Father\nanswered the petition, pro se, on June 20, 2023.\n\n        The trial court held a final hearing on March 8, 2024, at which Mother, Father,\nPetitioners, Father’s mother, and Zariah’s custodian all testified. The bulk of the proof at\ntrial centered on Mother and her history of substance abuse, as well as the domestic incident\nleading to her children’s removal by DCS. Mother and Father both testified about having\na toxic relationship with one another and detailed instances of domestic violence. Mother\ntestified that she intentionally hit Father with her car on July 11, 2022. For his part, Father\ndetailed an incident that occurred in 2021:\n\n       A. Yeah. In 2021 we were getting kind of lively with each other in the\n       driveway and I had grabbed her by her hair and was screaming at her, F-U,\n       F-U, and beating her head on the window in front of the kids in the backseat\n       of the car.\n\n       When I took [the Child] out of the backseat and put him in the house I was\n       coming back out to get the other kids out of the car so that we could finish\n       our little discrepancy and she was already gone.\n\n       And then the police showed up about four minutes later, if that, and I just\n       brought [the Child] out of the house and handed him to the police and then\n       they kind of threw me in the back of the car. She had dropped those charges.\n\n       For their part, Petitioners testified that the Child is doing well in their care, although\nhe was slightly delayed upon first coming into their home. The Child spends a lot of time\nwith his half-sister, Zariah, who lives next door to Petitioners with Gennie C.’s sister. The\nChild also has a relationship with his other half-sister, Jessalin, who lives with her father\nnearby. The Child has visitation with his paternal grandmother once a week on Fridays,\nand the grandmother drives from Lula, Georgia to see the Child. According to the\ngrandmother, she has come to have a good relationship with Petitioners, and they both love\nthe Child.

Father has\n       only visited with the minor child one time since the July 11, 2022 removal.\n       He has another minor child with [another woman] that he has not seen since\n       2021. He has not had a driver’s license since he was 17, he does not have a\n       vehicle, and he has no place to live. According to Father, he is “homeless on\n       the streets.” Father also has an extensive criminal history as well as a history\n       of illegal drug use dating back to when he was 17 years old. He has been\n       incarcerated for a majority of the child’s life. After the July 11, 2022 removal,\n       Father failed a drug test and went back to jail. Between the time of removal\n       and October 26, 2022, Father spent 70 days in jail. Father went back into jail\n       on October 26, 2022 and did not get released until May 30, 2023 after the\n\n       7\n           Some findings relating exclusively to Mother are omitted for brevity.\n                                                    -6-\n\fPetitions were filed. On or about August 15, 2023, Father went to a\nrehabilitation facility through September 14, 2023. While there, he was\nprescribed medications for mental disorders. Thereafter, he smoked\n[m]arijuana and failed a drug test. Then, on or about February 6, 2024, Father\nwas arrested for possession of [m]ethamphetamine, possession of\n[m]arijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Father pled guilty to\npossession of drug paraphernalia, and the 2 other charges were dismissed.\nThis was a violation of his probation as related to his previous [a]ggravated\n[b]urglary conviction. Father has been incarcerated since the February 6,\n2024 arrest. Father does not know if his 6 year [a]ggravated [b]urglary\nsentence will be flattened requiring him to serve all of his sentence. Per\nFather, the very soonest he could care for the minor children is in a year.\nFather also suffers from mental instability.\n\n         The court also finds that placing the minor child in Mother’s and\nFather’s legal and physical care and/or custody would pose a risk of\nsubstantial harm to the physical or psychological welfare of the children.\n“The use of the modifier ‘substantial’ indicates two things. First, it connotes\na real hazard or danger that is not minor, trivial, or insignificant. Second, it\nindicates that the harm must be more than a theoretical possibility.

Ct App. April 4, 2018)). In addition to the above, and yet\nagain, Mother and Father have a history of criminal illegal drug abuse.\nMother and Father continue to fail drug tests. There is a risk to the minor\nchildren that they would be exposed to illegal drugs while in their care. One\nof the minor children has tested positive for drugs. On July 11, 2022, Father,\nMother and Remi were in a vehicle at which time Mother and Father began\nto argue. This led to Father spraying paint on Mother’s face and Mother\nrunning over Father in a vehicle, after which time, Father had to be treated at\na local hospital for [a] broken leg. . . . [B]ased on Father’s history, there [is]\nno indication to this court that when Father is eventually released [from]\nincarceration, Father is capable of maintaining stable employment, income,\nhousing, transportation and sobriety. Simply put, neither Mother nor Father\nare fit to parent. As such, the court finds that based upon the facts in this case,\nplacing the children in Mother’s and Father’s care and custody would pose a\nrisk of substantial harm to the physical and/or psychological welfare of the\nyoung children. The court further finds that the risk of harm to the minor\nchildren is “substantial”, meaning the risk is real and not merely minor,\ntrivial, insignificant or a theoretical possibility.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f        Having reviewed the record, the evidence preponderates in favor of the trial court’s\nfactual findings regarding Father and section 36-1-113(g)(14). We agree that Father is not\nfit to parent the Child and that Father failed to manifest both an ability and willingness to\nparent. Father has been in and out of jail for the Child’s entire life and does not know when\nhe will be released. Father admitted at trial that he would have no place to live and no\nmeans with which to support the Child upon his release. Father’s extensive criminal history\nraises serious doubt regarding his “actual willingness to assume custody or financial\nresponsibility for the [C]hild.” In re Kaylene J., No. E2019-02122-COA-R3-PT, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL\n2135954</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17 (Tenn.

Given the long period\nof time the Child has been in Petitioners’ custody, and Father’s precarious, transient\nlifestyle, the Child would be at risk of substantial harm, both physical and psychological,\nif returned to Father’s custody. Particularly disturbing is Father’s flippant attitude about\ndrug abuse and domestic violence within his family. Father described smashing Mother’s\nhead into a car window while screaming “F-U” at her in front of the children as “getting\nlively” and a “little discrepancy.” Father indicated no remorse for this type of behavior at\ntrial, and we have great concern about returning the Child to these circumstances.\n\n       Consequently, the trial court correctly concluded that Petitioners proved this\nstatutory ground by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nBest interests\n\n       In addition to proving at least one statutory ground for termination, petitioners in a\ntermination case must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination serves the\nchild’s best interests. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn.

In this case, the trial court applied the correct statutory factors and\nengaged in a thorough analysis in its final order:\n\n  (A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the child’s\n      critical need for stability and continuity of placement throughout the\n      child’s minority.\n\n       [These] minor children have a critical need for stability and continuity of\n       placement throughout the children’s minority. The minor children have been\n       in the homes of the Petitioners since on or about July 11, 2022. Mother and\n       Father have failed to address their illegal drug use and provide a stable home\n       environment for the children that is drug free. Father is still incarcerated, and\n       he does not know when he will be released. Mother and Father have failed to\n       demonstrate any understanding of the children’s need for stability and\n       continuity. The Court finds that Mother and Father have not effectively\n       bonded with the minor children. The minor children are now thriving in the\n       homes of the Petitioners, and they live next to each other. The minor children\n       are now in stable, loving, and healthy environments with the Petitioners. As\n       these young children age, their needs will only increase. Termination of the\n       Respondents’ parental rights will increase the minor children’s stability and\n       allow the children to have stable placements throughout their lives.\n\n  (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to\n      have on the child’s emotional, psychological, and medical condition.\n\n       The young minor children have lived with the Petitioners since on or about\n       July 11, 2022. Based upon their young age, the Petitioners are the individuals\n       who have provided the most consistent emotional, psychological, and\n       medical support for these children. Neither Mother nor Father have\n       demonstrated that they can provide a stable environment that would promote\n       the children’s emotional, psychological and/or medical needs. The court\n       finds that a change of caregivers would dramatically and adversely [a]ffect\n       the children’s best interests. The Petitioners have provided positive, loving\n       and stable physical environments and have been supportive of the children’s\n       emotional, psychological, and/or medical needs. The minor children have\n       improved since going into the Petitioners’ care. As the children age, their\n       needs will only increase. This includes educational needs and mature\n                                             -9-\n\f   emotional needs. Mother and Father simply lack the ability and stability to\n   [e]nsure that the children’s ongoing and growing needs will be met in their\n   care.\n\n(C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability in\n    meeting the child’s basic material, educational, housing, and safety\n    needs.\n\n   Mother and Father have failed to demonstrate an ability to consistently\n   provide for the children’s material, housing, and safety needs. Mother and\n   Father continue to use illegal drugs and fail drug tests. Mother and Father\n   have not adequately addressed their drug abuse issues. Father has an\n   extensive criminal history, and he was arrested for drug related offenses just\n   prior to trial. Mother and Father have not shown employment, housing and\n   income stability. Father is incarcerated and does not know when he will be\n   released. Mother’s and Father’s economic circumstances remain unstable\n   and they have not demonstrated an ability to consistently provide for their\n   own needs, much less material, housing, and safety needs of the children.\n   The Court finds that while the children are now young, the needs of the\n   children will only increase as the children age and begin their formal\n   education. Finally, Mother and Father have a toxic relationship and history\n   of abuse in front of the minor children.\n\n(D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy parental\n    attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable expectation that\n    the parent can create such attachment.\n\n   The court finds that Mother and Father failed to offer proof at trial that they\n   have any parental attachment with the children, much less a secure and\n   healthy parental attachment. Based on the proof, the court finds that there is\n   not a reasonable expectation that Mother and/or Father can create such an\n   attachment for the reasons set forth herein including their ongoing drug use\n   as evidenced by the failed drug tests. . . . Father has only seen [the Child] one\n   time since the July 11, 2022 removal.\n\n(E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact\n    with the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate a\n    positive relationship with the child.\n\n   The court finds that Mother and Father have failed to maintain regular\n   visitation with the minor children. . . . Father . . . has basically had no\n   meaningful visitation with [the Child] due to his conduct, illegal drug use,\n   and ongoing incarceration. The court finds that Mother and Father have\n                                        - 10 -\n\f    displayed a “me first” attitude to the detriment of the minor children. Mother\n    and Father have prioritized their drug use and instability over cultivating a\n    positive relationship with the minor children.\n\n(F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent’s home.\n\n    The court did not hear much if any proof as related to this factor. However,\n    [the Child] was in the car when Father spray painted Mother’s face and she\n    ran Father over in a car. . . . [Father’s mother] also testified that Mother and\n    Father argued a lot in front of the minor children. Again, Mother and Father\n    have a toxic relationship and history of abuse in front of the minor children.\n\n(G) Whether the parent, parent’s home, or others in the parent’s household\n    trigger or exacerbate the child’s experience of trauma or post-traumatic\n    symptoms.\n\n    See the court’s analysis of factor (F).\n\n(H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment with\n    another person or persons in the absence of the parent.\n\n    The minor children have been consistently loved and cared for by the\n    Petitioners and their families. The children have greatly benefited from the\n    Petitioners’ love and support. The children have also developed a strong\n    bond with the Petitioners[] and their children. The minor children have\n    healthy attachments with Petitioners[] and their family.\n\n(I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships with persons\n    other than parents and caregivers, including biological or foster siblings,\n    and the likely impact of various available outcomes on these\n    relationships and the child’s access to information about the child’s\n    heritage.\n\n    The minor children have developed a positive and loving relationship with\n    the Petitioners[’] children and extended family. The Petitioners and minor\n    children live next door to each other, and the minor children are able to play,\n    eat meals and interact on a daily basis. The children are therefore being raised\n    together which is certainly in their best interest. The court finds that the\n    Petitioners seek to adopt, and through their positive relationship and\n    emotional support, the minor children will certainly have access to\n    information about their heritage and extended family.\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f(J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting adjustment of\n    circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and beneficial for\n    the child to be in the home of the parent, including consideration of\n    whether there is criminal activity in the home or by the parent, or the\n    use of alcohol, controlled substances, or controlled substance analogues\n    which may render the parent unable to consistently care for the child in\n    a safe and stable manner.\n\n    The court finds that Mother and Father have shown a lack of positive and/or\n    lasting adjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions that would make\n    it safe or beneficial for the children to be returned to their home. Mother and\n    Father continued to fail drug tests after the children were removed. Father\n    was arrested again for drug related offenses shortly before trial and remains\n    incarcerated.\n\n(K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available programs,\n    services, or community resources to assist in making a lasting\n    adjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions.\n\n    The Court finds that Mother and Father have failed to take advantage of\n    available programs, services, and/or community resources to assist them in\n    making a lasting adjustment of their circumstances and conduct. . . . [O]n or\n    about August 15, 2023, Father went to English Mountain Recovery through\n    September 14, 2023 for rehabilitation. Thereafter, Father smoked\n    [m]arijuana and failed a drug test. Then, as the trial date was approaching,\n    on or about February 6, 2024, Father was arrested for possession of\n    [m]ethamphetamine, possession of [m]arijuana, and possession of drug\n    paraphernalia. Father pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\n(L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent\n    in making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in the custody\n    of the department.\n\n    See factor (K) above.\n\n(M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in establishing\n    paternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or addressing the\n    circumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award of custody\n    unsafe and not in the child’s best interest.\n\n    See factors (J) and (K) above. Mother and Father have not demonstrated a\n    sense of urgency to regain custody and/or address the circumstances that lead\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\f    to removal. Mother and Father continue to fail drug tests, and Father’s\n    criminal conduct has continued.\n\n(N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or frequenting the\n    home of the parent, has shown brutality or physical, sexual, emotional,\n    or psychological abuse or neglect toward the child or any other child or\n    adult.\n\n    [The parents’] home environment was volatile, toxic and unhealthy as\n    confirmed by [Father’s mother]. The court finds that the relationship between\n    Mother and Father more likely than not detrimentally affected the minor\n    children.\n\n(O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for the child\n    or any other child.\n\n    The court finds that Mother and Father did not provide proof at trial that they\n    ever provided a safe and stable home for the children to reside. . . . Father\n    has another child that he has not seen since 2021. The Court finds that Mother\n    and Father have used illegal drugs at all times material to this case. The Court\n    finds that Mother and Father are unable to provide safe and stable care for\n    the children while abusing illegal drugs and/or under the influence of illegal\n    drugs. Again, Mother and Father have a toxic relationship and history of\n    abuse in front of the minor children.\n\n(P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the basic and\n    specific needs required for the child to thrive.\n\n    See factors (C) (J) and (O) above. The court finds that Mother and Father did\n    not offer proof at trial that they have ever demonstrated the ability or\n    understanding on how to provide for the basic needs and specific needs\n    required for the children to thrive. This is also evidenced by Mother’s and\n    Father’s continued drug use and Father’s continued criminal conduct. Mother\n    and Father do not understand and appreciate what they must do to meet the\n    children’s needs including remaining drug free. Father’s [criminal] conduct\n    and drug use has led to continued incarceration. The court finds that Mother\n    and Father chose illegal drug use as opposed to meeting the needs of the\n    minor children so as to enable the minor children to thrive.\n\n(Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and commitment to\n    creating and maintaining a home that meets the child’s basic and specific\n    needs and in which the child can thrive.\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\f    See factors (C) (J) (O) and (P) above. Additionally, Mother and Father have\n    not demonstrated the ability and commitment to create and maintain a home\n    that meets the minor children’s needs in which the children can thrive.\n\n(R) Whether the physical environment of the parent’s home is healthy and\n    safe for the child.\n\n    Father is incarcerated, and in his words, is “homeless on the streets.” . . .\n    Mother’s and Father’s home environment prior to removal was unstable and\n    volatile as set forth above. Mother’s and Father’s conduct reflects instability.\n\n(S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token financial\n    support for the child.\n\n    Mother and Father have failed to consistently provide more than token\n    financial support for the children. Neither Mother [nor] Father has paid direct\n    financial support for the benefit of the children since removal.\n\n(T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would be\n    detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n    effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n\n    The court finds that Mother’s and Father’s mental and/or emotional lack of\n    fitness would be detrimental to the minor children and would prevent Mother\n    and Father from consistently and effectively providing a safe and stable\n    environment in care of the minor children. Again, Mother and Father\n    continue to use illegal drugs and failed drug tests after removal. The court\n    finds that it would be detrimental to place the minor child back into the care\n    of Mother and Father.\n\n            Upon analyzing the factors set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated\n    §36-1-113(i)(1), the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n    termination of Mother’s and Father’s parental rights is in the best interests of\n    the minor children. The Guardian Ad Litem agrees. The termination of the\n    Respondents’ parental rights and subsequent adoption will promote stability\n    for the children, and allow the children to continue to live in stable and loving\n    home environments that they have enjoyed since July 11, 2022. For well over\n    a year while with the Petitioners, the minor children’s needs have been met\n    and they are thriving. The Petitioners, their children, and their family all have\n    a strong bond with the children. Mother and Father have not provided any\n    direct financial support. The children have a right to stable, safe and\n    continuity of placement, and these children have a right to be free from\n    neglect and to be nurtured by appropriate caregivers, or the Petitioners in this\n                                         - 14 -\n\f       case. Mother and Father cannot rest on their rights while ignoring the rights\n       of their children.\n\n        The trial court’s findings of fact are apt and supported by the record. Nearly, if not\nall, of the best interest factors favor terminating Father’s parental rights. Father is not fit\nto assume custody of the Child and has taken no meaningful steps toward being able to do\nso. Father essentially has no relationship with the Child as he has not seen him since 2022.\nIn the meantime, the Child is bonded with Petitioners’ family and is being raised with\nMother’s other children, the Child’s half-siblings. In light of all the foregoing, terminating\nFather’s parental rights is in the Child’s best interests. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\ncourt.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the Circuit Court for Bradley County is affirmed, and this case is\nremanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs on appeal are assessed to the\nappellant, Mark M., for which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     KRISTI M.

In her Complaint, the Plaintiff alleges that she was driving on the\n\nPhiladelphia Pike and made a left turn at Marsh Road when the Defendant’s vehicle\n\ncollided with Plaintiff’s. Apparently the Plaintiff vehicle was turning left and the\n\nDefendant vehicle was going straight in the opposite direction when they collided.\n\n         2.    So the question becomes: who had the right of way?\n\n         3.    Complicating matters for the Plaintiff is that the Complaint says\n\nPlaintiff had a solid green left turn arrow. But in her deposition, Plaintiff testified\n\nthat there was no turn arrow, merely a green light. Defendant seizes upon this\n\ntestimony to argue that Plaintiff admits she did not have a green arrow giving her the\n\fright of way. Defendant seeks summary judgment on the basis of this testimony,\n\narguing that this admission means Plaintiff cannot recover and Defendant is entitled\n\nto judgment.\n\n      4.       Plaintiff argues that discovery is ongoing and is not due for completion\n\nfor many months yet. Thus, Plaintiff argues, summary disposition is inappropriate\n\nat this stage. Defendant is unsure what else there is to discover, since Plaintiff has\n\nadmitted turning in front of oncoming traffic.\n\n      5.       It is unclear to the Court at this point exactly what happened and who\n\nhad the right of way.       For example, in contradiction to Plaintiff’s deposition\n\ntestimony, the narrative police report appended to the motion states that Plaintiff\n\n“observed a solid green arrow indicating she had the right of way.” Surely there is\n\na simple answer whether the intersection is controlled by a basic green light or a\n\ntraffic arrow. It is less certain which one was lighted when Plaintiff went through it.\n\nA deposition of Defendant and/or other eyewitnesses may clear up exactly who\n\nstruck whom. Or not.\n\n      6.       For now, it is enough to say there are material facts in dispute that\n\nfurther discovery may (or may not) put to rest. The Court cannot grant summary\n\ndisposition in this matter until there are no material facts in dispute.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f      7.     Defendant’s motion is therefore denied, without prejudice to return\n\nonce fact discovery is completed if Defendant believes she can convince the Court\n\nthat there are no material facts in dispute.\n\n      Motion for Summary Judgment DENIED without prejudice.\n\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                               /s/ Charles E.

On February 11, 2025, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint against\n\nCircle for claims of unjust enrichment and replacement of lost or destroyed securities\n\ncertificates.2 Plaintiff seeks to recover USDC tokens from Circle, the issuer of such\n\ncoins, after an erroneous transfer.3\n\n\n\n\n1\n  See generally Defendant Circle Internet Financial, LLC’s Motion for Reargument, D.I. 16\n(“MFR”).\n2\n  See generally Second Amended Complaint, D.I. 5 (“SAC”).\n3\n  Id. ¶ 2.\n\f    2. On April 3, 2025, Circle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim.4 On August 18, 2025, the Court denied Circle’s motion to dismiss\n\nPlaintiff’s complaint under Superior Court Civil Rule 12(b)(6).5\n\n    3. Circle filed this motion for reargument on August 25, 2025, asserting that the\n\nCourt’s decision is: (1) “based on a misapprehension of facts . . . with respect to\n\nCircle’s motion to dismiss” Plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim; and (2) “overlooks\n\nlegal principles that would have a controlling effect with respect to” replacement of\n\nlost or destroyed securities.6\n\n    4. Under Superior Court Civil Rule 59(e), the only issue is whether the Court\n\noverlooked something that would have changed the outcome of the underlying\n\ndecision.7 Thus, the motion will be granted only if “the Court has overlooked a\n\ncontrolling precedent or legal principles, or the Court has misapprehended the law\n\nor facts such as would have changed the outcome of the underlying decision.” 8 A\n\nmotion for reargument is not an opportunity for a party to rehash the arguments\n\nalready decided by the Court or to present new arguments not previously raised.9 A\n\n\n\n4\n  See Defendant Circle Internet Financial, LLC’s Motion to Dismiss, D.I. 10 (“MTD”).\n5\n  Ventura v.

Circle first argues that the Court misinterpreted the significance of the interest\n\nit earns on USDC tokens to Plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim. 12 The Court held\n\nthat it was plausible Circle benefits from the erroneous transfer because it earns\n\ninterest from the USDC tokens it issues, so further factual development is needed at\n\nthis juncture.13 According to Circle, “discovery is unnecessary and futile” because\n\nthere is “no factual dispute” that Circle earns interest on all its reserves of USDC,\n\nbut the interest earned has no relationship to Plaintiff’s erroneous transfer.14\n\n     6. Circle misapprehends the standard governing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The\n\ninquiry is not whether there is or is not a factual dispute, but whether the complaint\n\nalleges facts that state a plausible claim.15 The Court considered Circle’s same\n\nargument in denying its motion to dismiss and determined that the limited record is\n\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal at this stage of litigation.16 Circle offers no new\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Brenner, 2000 WL 972649, at *1.\n11\n   Newborn v.

Circle’s second argument claims that the Court overlooked legal principles by\n\nfailing to address each element under 6 Del. C. § 8-504 in its decision.17 Given that\n\nthe parties’ dispute centered on whether Plaintiffs’ USDC tokens constitute a\n\n“certified security” under Section 8-102, and it was at least reasonably conceivable\n\nthat the USDC tokens meet that definition, the Court concluded further factual\n\ndevelopment was necessary to resolve the dispute.18\n\n     8. Circle does not provide any support for the assertion that the Court overlooked\n\ncontrolling legal principles. Circle argued in its motion to dismiss that Plaintiff’s\n\nclaims did not meet the requirements of Section 8-504.19 The standard governing a\n\nmotion under Rule 59(e) does not permit a movant to rehash arguments that the\n\nCourt already decided. The Court considered Circle’s argument in its decision to\n\ndeny Circle’s motion to dismiss, but Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to\n\nreasonably infer that the USDC tokens can be replaced under Section 8-504.\n\nMoreover, not only does the Second Amended Complaint comply with Delaware’s\n\npleading standard, but the complexities of this case require further factual\n\ndevelopment to appropriately resolve the dispute as mentioned above.\n\n\n17\n   MTR at 4.\n18\n   Ventura, 2025 WL 2390518, at *4.\n19\n   MTD at 25–27.\n\f   9.

For the following reasons, the Court grants the IFP application and dismisses the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n        The subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal district courts is limited and is set forth\n\ngenerally at 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332. Under those statutes, federal jurisdiction is available\n\nonly when a “federal question” is presented, id. § 1331, or the parties are of diverse citizenship\n\nand the amount in controversy “exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and\n\ncosts,” id. § 1332(a). A party seeking relief in the district court must plead facts that bring the suit\n\nwithin the court’s jurisdiction or suffer dismissal of the case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a); 12(h)(3).\n\n        Plaintiff, a resident of Washington, D.C., sues United Medical Center and Cedar Hill\n\nRegional Medical Center (“Cedar Hill”) located in the District’s southeast quadrant. See Compl.,\n\nECF No. 1 at 2, 4. Plaintiff alleges cryptically that he has fluid in his eye from an assault in 2014,\n\nhas fluid in his head from a concussion he sustained in 2008, and was “sexually assaulted by a\n\nmale nurse assistant” at an unstated place and time. Id. at 4. Plaintiff “accuse[s]” United Medical\n\fCenter of misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, failure to provide necessary medical care, and\n\ndiscrimination but has alleged no supporting facts. Id. Plaintiff makes no allegations against Cedar\n\nHill, and he demands no relief. Because the complaint does not establish diversity jurisdiction or\n\npresent a federal question, this case will be dismissed by separate order.\n\n\n\n\nDate: October 7, 2025                                        _______________________\n                                                             CARL J.

Additionally, De\n       Avila and Ulloa argue that their prosecution violated the Due\n       Process Clause and exceeded Congress’s authority under the\n       Felonies Clause of the Constitution because the offense had no\n       nexus with the United States.\n              The government moves for summary affirmance, arguing\n       that binding authority forecloses their claims. 1 After review, we\n       grant the government’s motion.\n              Summary disposition is appropriate where “the position of\n       one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can\n       be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where,\n\n\n       1 The appellants did not file a response to the motion for summary affirmance.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 23-10311         Document: 30-1         Date Filed: 10/07/2025         Page: 4 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       4                          Opinion of the Court                       23-10311\n\n       as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.” Groendyke\n       Transp., Inc. v. Davis, 406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir. 1969). 2\n               When, as here, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the\n       indictment in the district court based on subject matter jurisdiction,\n       we review the district court’s denial de novo. United States v. Alfonso,\n       104 F.4th 815, 820 (11th Cir. 2024), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct. 2706\n       (2025).      “Likewise, we review de novo a district court’s\n       interpretation of a statute and whether a statute is constitutional.”\n       Id. (alteration adopted) (quotations omitted).\n              Under our prior-panel-precedent rule, “a prior panel’s\n       holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is\n       overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the\n       Supreme Court or by this [C]ourt sitting en banc.” United States v.\n       Archer, 531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008).\n              The MDLEA makes it a crime to “knowingly or\n       intentionally . . . possess with intent to manufacture or distribute,\n       a controlled substance” on board “a vessel subject to the\n       jurisdiction of the United States,” and to conspire to do the same.\n       46 U.S.C. §§ 70503(a)(1), (e)(1), 70506(b). The statute defines a\n       “vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” as including\n       “a vessel without nationality.” Id. § 70502(c)(1)(A). A “vessel\n       without nationality” is defined to include “a vessel aboard which\n\n       2 Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc)\n\n       (holding that all decisions from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued before\n       the close of business on September 30, 1981, are “binding as precedent in the\n       Eleventh Circuit”).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 23-10311         Document: 30-1        Date Filed: 10/07/2025         Page: 5 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       23-10311                  Opinion of the Court                                5\n\n       the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry and for\n       which the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and\n       unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.” Id.\n       § 70502(d)(1)(C). The MDLEA “applies even though the [criminal]\n       act is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United\n       States.” Id. § 70503(b).\n               The MDLEA has been the subject of numerous legal\n       challenges over the years. Most recently, in Alfonso, we rejected a\n       constitutional challenge that Congress lacked the authority under\n       the Felonies Clause of the Constitution3 to prosecute offenses\n       occurring in an EEZ—“the waters extending 200 nautical miles\n       seaward of and adjacent to the territorial sea of a nation”—because\n       those waters were not part of the “high seas.” 104 F.4th at 818. In\n       rejecting this challenge, we held that “international law does not\n       limit the Felonies Clause” and that EEZs were “part of the ‘high\n       seas’ for purposes of the Felonies Clause.” Id. at 823, 826–27.\n              We then reaffirmed Alfonso’s holding in United States v.\n       Canario-Vilomar, holding that Congress was not constrained by\n       international law in crafting the MDLEA, and rejecting the\n       appellant’s argument that Congress could not reach his conduct\n       because it occurred in Columbia’s EEZ. 128 F.4th 1374, 1381–82\n\n       3 Under Article I, Section 8, Clause 10 of the Constitution, Congress has “three\n\n       distinct grants of power: (1) the power to define and punish piracies, (the\n       Piracies Clause); (2) the power to define and punish felonies committed on the\n       high Seas, (the Felonies Clause); and (3) the power to define and punish\n       offenses against the law of nations (the Offences Clause).” Alfonso, 104 F.4th\n       at 820 (alteration adopted) (quotations omitted).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 23-10311      Document: 30-1      Date Filed: 10/07/2025     Page: 6 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       6                      Opinion of the Court                  23-10311\n\n       (11th Cir. 2025). Thus, Santiago’s and Ulloa’s as-applied\n       constitutional challenge to Congress’s constitutional authority to\n       regulate conduct in Columbia’s EEZ is squarely foreclosed by\n       Alfonso and Canario-Vilomar.\n              Additionally, in Canario-Vilomar, we rejected the appellant’s\n       claim that the MDLEA is unconstitutional because § 70502(d)(1)(C)\n       grants the United States jurisdiction based on a definition of a\n       “vessel without nationality” that includes vessels that are not\n       stateless under international law. 128 F.4th at 1380–81. We\n       explained that because “the Felonies Clause is not limited by\n       customary international law,” “[i]t follows that international law\n       cannot limit Congress’s authority to define ‘stateless vessel’ for\n       purposes of the MDLEA.” Id. at 1381 (quotations omitted). Thus,\n       Santiago’s and Ulloa’s constitutional challenge to the definition of\n       a “vessel without nationality” in § 70502(d)(1)(C) is squarely\n       foreclosed, and they are not entitled to relief.\n              Finally, we have repeatedly held that “the MDLEA is a valid\n       exercise of Congress’s power under the Felonies Clause as applied\n       to drug trafficking crimes without a ‘nexus’ to the United States.”\n       United States v. Cabezas-Montano, 949 F.3d 567, 587 (11th Cir. 2020)\n       (collecting cases); United States v. Hernandez, 864 F.3d 1292, 1303\n       (11th Cir. 2017); United States v. Campbell, 743 F.3d 802, 810–12 (11th\n       Cir. 2014); United States v. Rendon, 354 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.\n       2003) (“[T]his circuit and other circuits have not embellished the\n       MDLEA with a nexus requirement.”). Relatedly, we have also\n       repeatedly “held that the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause\n\fUSCA11 Case: 23-10311     Document: 30-1     Date Filed: 10/07/2025    Page: 7 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       23-10311              Opinion of the Court                        7\n\n       does not prohibit the trial and conviction of aliens captured on the\n       high seas while drug trafficking because the MDLEA provides clear\n       notice that all nations prohibit and condemn drug trafficking\n       aboard stateless vessels on the high seas.” Cabezas-Montano, 949\n       F.3d at 587; Campbell, 743 F.3d at 812 (same). Accordingly, De Avila\n       and Ulloa are not entitled to relief on this claim.\n              Thus, the government is clearly correct, as a matter of law,\n       that the appellants’ claims are foreclosed by circuit precedent.\n       Consequently, summary affirmance is proper in this case, and we\n       GRANT the government’s motion.\n\f",

Additionally, De\n       Avila and Ulloa argue that their prosecution violated the Due\n       Process Clause and exceeded Congress’s authority under the\n       Felonies Clause of the Constitution because the offense had no\n       nexus with the United States.\n              The government moves for summary affirmance, arguing\n       that binding authority forecloses their claims. 1 After review, we\n       grant the government’s motion.\n              Summary disposition is appropriate where “the position of\n       one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can\n       be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where,\n\n\n       1 The appellants did not file a response to the motion for summary affirmance.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 23-10311         Document: 30-1         Date Filed: 10/07/2025         Page: 4 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       4                          Opinion of the Court                       23-10311\n\n       as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.” Groendyke\n       Transp., Inc. v.

The MDLEA “applies even though the [criminal]\n       act is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United\n       States.” Id. § 70503(b).\n               The MDLEA has been the subject of numerous legal\n       challenges over the years. Most recently, in Alfonso, we rejected a\n       constitutional challenge that Congress lacked the authority under\n       the Felonies Clause of the Constitution3 to prosecute offenses\n       occurring in an EEZ—“the waters extending 200 nautical miles\n       seaward of and adjacent to the territorial sea of a nation”—because\n       those waters were not part of the “high seas.” 104 F.4th at 818. In\n       rejecting this challenge, we held that “international law does not\n       limit the Felonies Clause” and that EEZs were “part of the ‘high\n       seas’ for purposes of the Felonies Clause.” Id. at 823, 826–27.\n              We then reaffirmed Alfonso’s holding in United States v.\n       Canario-Vilomar, holding that Congress was not constrained by\n       international law in crafting the MDLEA, and rejecting the\n       appellant’s argument that Congress could not reach his conduct\n       because it occurred in Columbia’s EEZ. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">128 F.4th 1374</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1381–82\n\n       3 Under Article I, Section 8, Clause 10 of the Constitution, Congress has “three\n\n       distinct grants of power: (1) the power to define and punish piracies, (the\n       Piracies Clause); (2) the power to define and punish felonies committed on the\n       high Seas, (the Felonies Clause); and (3) the power to define and punish\n       offenses against the law of nations (the Offences Clause).” Alfonso, 104 F.4th\n       at 820 (alteration adopted) (quotations omitted).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 23-10311      Document: 30-1      Date Filed: 10/07/2025     Page: 6 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       6                      Opinion of the Court                  23-10311\n\n       (11th Cir. 2025). Thus, Santiago’s and Ulloa’s as-applied\n       constitutional challenge to Congress’s constitutional authority to\n       regulate conduct in Columbia’s EEZ is squarely foreclosed by\n       Alfonso and Canario-Vilomar.\n              Additionally, in Canario-Vilomar, we rejected the appellant’s\n       claim that the MDLEA is unconstitutional because § 70502(d)(1)(C)\n       grants the United States jurisdiction based on a definition of a\n       “vessel without nationality” that includes vessels that are not\n       stateless under international law. 128 F.4th at 1380–81. We\n       explained that because “the Felonies Clause is not limited by\n       customary international law,” “[i]t follows that international law\n       cannot limit Congress’s authority to define ‘stateless vessel’ for\n       purposes of the MDLEA.” Id. at 1381 (quotations omitted). Thus,\n       Santiago’s and Ulloa’s constitutional challenge to the definition of\n       a “vessel without nationality” in § 70502(d)(1)(C) is squarely\n       foreclosed, and they are not entitled to relief.\n              Finally, we have repeatedly held that “the MDLEA is a valid\n       exercise of Congress’s power under the Felonies Clause as applied\n       to drug trafficking crimes without a ‘nexus’ to the United States.”\n       United States v.

Amy Hadley’s home was badly dam-\naged when local law enforcement executed a search warrant\nlooking for a fugitive they incorrectly believed was inside her\nhome. When both the City of South Bend and St. Joseph\nCounty declined to pay for the $16,000 in resulting damages,\nHadley sued for compensation under the Takings Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The district\ncourt dismissed her complaint, concluding that she failed to\n\f2                                                 No. 24-2448\n\nstate a claim, a decision she now appeals. Because Hadley’s\narguments for compensation run contrary to our precedent,\nwe affirm.\n\n                        I. Background\n\n   The district court dismissed this case at the pleadings\nstage, so we accept the following well-pled allegations as true\non appeal. Emerson v. Dart, 109 F.4th 936, 941 (7th Cir. 2024).\n    Amy Hadley lives in South Bend, Indiana with her two\nchildren. In June 2022, local law enforcement believed a mur-\nder suspect, John Parnell Thomas, had (based on his IP ad-\ndress) accessed his Facebook account from within Hadley’s\nhome. Officers spent the evening surveilling Hadley’s house\nfrom afar but saw no sign of Thomas. The following day,\nhowever, someone again accessed the same Facebook account\nfrom the same IP address. Based on this information, officers\nobtained a lawful warrant to search Hadley’s home for\nThomas.\n    Warrant in hand, more law enforcement gathered outside\nthe home to execute it. Before entering, they demanded\nThomas exit, shouting their commands from outside using a\nbullhorn. Hadley’s fifteen-year-old son—the only person in\nthe home—surrendered. Hadley arrived at the scene before\nofficers entered her home. She professed to have no connec-\ntion with, or knowledge of, Thomas.\n   Officers were undeterred. Believing Thomas was in the\nhome and refusing to leave, they entered the house forcefully.\nThey broke windows and launched thirty cannisters of tear\ngas into the home. The gas destroyed all “porous” items in the\nhouse, like clothing and beds (Hadley had to sleep in her car\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   3\n\nfor days until toxic fumes from the gas dissipated). Police also\nwrecked internal security cameras, punched holes in the\nwalls, ransacked furniture and a closet, and tore down a panel\non a wall and a fan in a bathroom.\n    After the government refused to compensate Hadley for\nher damages, she sued defendants under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for\n$16,000. Relevant here, she argued the state officials violated\nher Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by taking her\nproperty (destroying it) “for public use” (while searching for\na fugitive) and thus owed her “just compensation.” See U.S.\nCONST. amends. V, XIV. Hadley did not challenge the warrant\npolice obtained to search her home, nor did she assert that po-\nlice executed the warrant “unreasonabl[y]” in violation of the\nFourth Amendment. Id. amend. IV.\n    Though Hadley filed suit in Indiana state court, St. Joseph\nCounty removed the action to the federal district court in\nSouth Bend. After removal, defendants City of South Bend,\nthe South Bend Police Department, St. Joseph County, the St.\nJoseph Police Department, and the St. Joseph Board of Com-\nmissioners moved to dismiss. They principally argued that\nJohnson v. Manitowoc County, 635 F.3d 331 (7th Cir. 2011), fore-\ncloses Hadley’s claim. The district court agreed and dismissed\nher complaint. Hadley appealed.\n\n                          II. Analysis\n\n    Hadley sues via 42 U.S.C. §1983, a procedural vehicle for\na plaintiff to seek damages from state officials who violate her\nconstitutional rights. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 393–94\n(1989). To state a claim under §1983, Hadley must show\n(among other things) that she was “deprived of a right\n\f4                                                   No. 24-2448\n\nsecured by the Constitution or federal law.” Thurman v. Vill.\nof Homewood, 446 F.3d 682, 687 (7th Cir. 2006).\n    Hadley asserts her Fifth Amendment right to just compen-\nsation under the Takings Clause, applicable to the states\nthrough the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. The Takings Clause provides: “nor shall private prop-\nerty be taken for public use, without just compensation.” U.S.\nCONST. amend. V. Whether Hadley’s §1983 claim survives\ndismissal turns on whether the Fifth Amendment does in fact\nentitle her to compensation for the property damage police\ncaused while executing a valid warrant.\n    The district court, relying on Johnson, concluded the Fifth\nAmendment does not entitle her to compensation and dis-\nmissed the complaint. Hadley appeals, urging us to overrule\nJohnson and hold that: “innocent homeowner[s] with no con-\nnection to the sought-after suspect[,] whose property the\n[government] intentionally and severely damage[s] through a\nmilitary-style assault … to execute a warrant to apprehend [a]\nsuspect … when the property otherwise would not have been\ndamaged” deserve compensation under the Fifth Amend-\nment. Defendants, for their part, urge the opposite. They ask\nus to preserve and apply Johnson here to reject Hadley’s claim.\n   Because we agree that Johnson controls, we affirm. Under\nJohnson, the Fifth Amendment does not require the state to\ncompensate for property damage resulting from police exe-\ncuting a lawful search warrant. That is precisely what hap-\npened here: the damage Hadley suffered happened because\npolice executed a lawful search warrant in her home. Hadley\ncannot escape Johnson’s application in this case by arguing\nthere is some other set of facts that should compel us to revisit\nJohnson. We may face difficult questions regarding the\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   5\n\napplication of the Takings Clause in future cases. That does\nnothing to change the fact that Johnson’s application to dam-\nage caused when local officials execute a valid search warrant\nis both clear and controlling. Thus, we affirm the district\ncourt’s order dismissing Hadley’s complaint.\n    We proceed in three steps. First, we explain that Johnson\ncontrols and requires us to affirm. Second, we explain Had-\nley’s contrary arguments and conclude that they do not cast\ndoubt that Johnson controls here. Third, we briefly explain\nthat—even setting Johnson aside—we have serious doubts\nabout Hadley’s proposed holding.\n   A. Johnson, which addressed facts nearly identical to\n      Hadley’s, controls and requires us to aﬃrm.\n    This Court decided Johnson in 2011. There, the plaintiff\n(Johnson), like Hadley, suffered significant property damage\nwhile police executed a valid warrant.\n    Johnson owned a trailer and garage on a rural lot in Wis-\nconsin. Johnson, 635 F.3d at 332. He rented the property to an\nindividual suspected of murder. Id. The police obtained a\nwarrant and searched the trailer for evidence. Id. at 333. While\nexecuting the warrant, police inflicted extensive damage. Id.\nat 333–34. In the trailer, they damaged the main door, re-\nmoved wall panels in the bedroom, ripped up carpet in the\nhallway and bedroom, and cut swatches from a couch. Id. In\nthe garage, police searched for blood that might have seeped\ninto cracks in the concrete floor by jackhammering an eight-\nby-two-foot section of it. Id. at 333.\n   Johnson sued for damages, bringing two claims. First,\nthough he did not challenge the warrant’s lawfulness, he ar-\ngued police acted unreasonably when executing the warrant\n\f6                                                     No. 24-2448\n\nin violation of the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 334–36. Johnson\nalso brought a claim under the Fifth Amendment, urging that\npolice owed him just compensation for the property they de-\nstroyed while executing the search warrant. Id. at 336.\n    We rejected both claims, devoting the lion’s share of our\nanalysis to Johnson’s Fourth Amendment claim. Id. at 334–36.\nAfter finding no Fourth Amendment violation, we turned to\nJohnson’s Fifth Amendment theory. We observed that the po-\nlice’s “actions were taken under the state’s police power,” ra-\nther than the power of eminent domain. Id. at 336. For that\nreason, “[t]he Takings Clause claim [wa]s a non-starter” be-\ncause “the Takings Clause does not apply when property is\nretained or damaged as the result of the government’s exer-\ncise of its authority pursuant to some power other than the\npower of eminent domain.” Id.\n    It is no surprise that with factual parallels so striking, John-\nson’s holding bars Hadley’s claim. Hadley, like Johnson, suf-\nfered extensive personal property damage at the hands of po-\nlice executing a lawful search warrant. Hadley, like Johnson,\ndoes not argue the warrant police secured was invalid or de-\nfective. Rather, Hadley, like Johnson, seeks compensation\nfrom police under the Fifth Amendment for the damage she\nsuffered. Johnson’s application to such facts is plain: the Fifth\nAmendment does not require a state to compensate a plaintiff\nfor damages sustained while police execute a lawful search\nwarrant. Id.\n   Recognizing that Johnson speaks to her claim directly,\nHadley attempts to cast doubt on Johnson’s application be-\nyond the facts before us. She takes issue principally with John-\nson’s suggestion that takings under eminent domain are com-\npensable, whereas takings under the police power are not. Id.\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   7\n\nShe says this is incompatible with Supreme Court precedent\nand so urges us to overrule Johnson.\n   B. Hadley presents no grounds to overturn Johnson.\n    If this case presented a claim outside the context of police\nexecuting a lawful search warrant, we might need to grapple\nwith more of Hadley’s arguments. But it does not. Johnson set-\ntled the issue here: whether the Takings Clause applies when\npolice damage property while executing a lawful search war-\nrant. Johnson forecloses a takings claim under these circum-\nstances, and Hadley gives us no reason to set that holding\naside.\n    We could end with this straightforward analysis showing\nJohnson controls. Yet Hadley makes some sound observations\nabout our takings analysis in Johnson—abbreviated as it was,\nbecause Johnson’s primary claim arose under the Fourth\nAmendment—and highlights some issues we may need to\ngrapple with in future cases. Understanding Hadley’s argu-\nment requires some background. The “police power” refers to\na state’s general authority “to determine, primarily, what\nmeasures are appropriate or needful for the protection of the\npublic morals, the public health, or the public safety.” Mugler\nv. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 661 (1887). Historically, “eminent do-\nmain” referred to a state’s power to physically take property\nby formally condemning it. Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 594\nU.S. 139, 148 (2021). The prototypical Takings Clause claim\narises when a state physically takes land for public use by, for\nexample, condemning a warehouse and using it for military\npurposes. United States v. Gen. Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 375\n(1945).\n\f8                                                     No. 24-2448\n\n    Though the Supreme Court has at times suggested that\nthe Takings Clause is limited to this more prototypical con-\ntext, e.g., Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U.S. 442, 452 (1996); United\nStates v. Dow, 357 U.S. 17, 21 (1958); United States v. Carmack,\n329 U.S. 230, 236–37 (1946), the Court has also rejected rigid\ndistinctions between “eminent domain” and “police power”\nactions, e.g., Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1023–\n25 (1992); Penn. Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S.\n104, 123–28 (1978); Penn. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415\n(1922). More recently, the Court observed that, given “the\nnearly infinite variety of ways in which government actions\nor regulations can affect property interests,” there is “no\nmagic formula” and “few invariable rules” in deciding\n“whether a given government interference with property is a\ntaking.” Ark. Game & Fish Comm’n v. United States, 568 U.S. 23,\n31 (2012).\n    Thus, whether through eminent domain or other\nmeasures, a taking can occur through “two distinct classes”\nof government action: (1) permanent deprivations or destruc-\ntions of physical property or (2) actions that regulate how a\nperson can use their property, but do not appropriate, physi-\ncally control, or destroy it. Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S.\n519, 522–23 (1992). The first is called a “per se” taking; the sec-\nond is called a “regulatory taking.” Cedar Point Nursery, 594\nU.S. at 149. A regulatory taking may occur when the state ex-\nercises its police power to regulate how one uses property. Id.\nThat said, “[w]henever a regulation results in a physical ap-\npropriation of property, a per se taking has occurred.” Id.\n     One way a government exercises its police power is when\nit investigates criminal activity. See id. at 160–61. But the Court\nhas held the Fifth Amendment does not apply when a\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   9\n\ngovernment takes property by asserting a “pre-existing limi-\ntation upon the landowner’s title.” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1028–29.\nThese limitations include “traditional common law privi-\nleges” like the “privilege to enter property to effect an arrest\nor enforce the criminal law under certain circumstances.” Ce-\ndar Point, 594 U.S. at 160–61. As such, “government searches\nthat are consistent with the Fourth Amendment and state law\ncannot be said to take any property right from landowners.”\nId. at 161.\n    For example, in Bennis, the Court held that lawfully seiz-\ning a vehicle through civil forfeiture after a criminal investi-\ngation is not a taking under the Fifth Amendment. Bennis, 516\nU.S. at 452–53. There, the state seized a car after one of the\ncar’s owners, the husband, “engaged in sexual activity with a\nprostitute” inside the car. Id. at 443. The Court declined to\naward compensation to the other owner (the wife) for the\nauto’s seizure because the state lawfully seized the car as an\ninstrumentality of a crime. Id. at 452–53. No taking occurred,\nthe Court reasoned, because the state “already lawfully ac-\nquired [the car] under the exercise of governmental authority\nother than the power of eminent domain.” Id. at 452.\n     Several of our sister circuits have recently considered\nwhether a taking occurs when a state damages property while\nexercising its law-enforcement powers. E.g., Baker v. City of\nMcKinney, 84 F.4th 378 (5th Cir. 2023) (analyzing whether a\ntaking occurred when police damaged a plaintiff’s home dur-\ning a standoff with an armed fugitive), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct.\n11 (mem.) (2024); Slaybaugh v. Rutherford County, 114 F.4th 593\n(6th Cir. 2024) (analyzing whether a taking occurred when po-\nlice damaged a plaintiff’s home while arresting a murder sus-\npect), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct. 1959 (2025). A decision from the\n\f10                                                  No. 24-2448\n\nNinth Circuit is also forthcoming. Pena v. City of Los Angeles,\nNo. 24-2422 (9th Cir. 2025), oral argument heard (Jan. 16, 2025)\n(raising whether a business owner may bring a takings claim\nfor damage to his shop caused when police sought to appre-\nhend a fugitive). But so far, no circuit to consider this issue\nhas awarded a plaintiff compensation. Nonetheless, two pre-\nsent Justices recently expressed interest in this issue. In their\nwords, whether a taking occurs when law enforcement dam-\nages property remains an “open question … that would ben-\nefit from further percolation” in the courts of appeals. Baker,\n145 S. Ct. at 13 (Sotomayor, J., statement respecting denial of\ncertiorari, joined by Gorsuch, J.).\n    With this controversy in hand, Hadley prods us to enter\nthis debate anew. She urges us to abandon Johnson because it\nsuggested the Takings Clause categorically does not apply\nwhen a government exercises its police powers. She says this\ndistinction does not match recent Supreme Court precedent,\nwhich recognizes that a state may impose a taking when it\nexercises its police power to, for example, regulate a land use.\nYee, 503 U.S. at 522–23. Because she says Johnson impermissi-\nbly forecloses any takings claim arising from a state using its\npolice power writ large, she insists that Johnson must be over-\nruled.\n   We see things differently. As noted above, Johnson staked\nour Circuit’s position on the specific issue in Hadley’s case—\nwhether the Fifth Amendment requires compensation when\npolice damage property while executing a valid search war-\nrant. The answer is no. Johnson, 635 F.3d at 336. And, as dis-\ncussed above, Johnson’s application in the law-enforcement\ncontext is well supported by precedent from our sister circuits\nand the Supreme Court. Hadley points us to no authority\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                    11\n\nshowing this position is categorically wrong. Accordingly, we\nneed not decide whether Johnson governs outside Hadley’s\ncontext. “[J]udicial opinions are not statutes,” and thus “[i]t is\nalways important to understand opinions in light of their\nholdings and not take ambiguous statements for all they\nmight be worth.” Vinning-El v. Evans, 657 F.3d 591, 595 (7th\nCir. 2011). We adjudicate the case before us and “general ex-\npressions must be read in light of the subject under consider-\nation.” Lewis v. Zatecky, 993 F.3d 994, 1003 (7th Cir. 2021)\n(quoting United States v. Skoien, 614 F.3d 638, 640 (7th Cir.\n2010) (en banc)).\n    Indeed, Johnson itself suggests its holding might not apply\noutside of the context of law enforcement damaging property\nwhile executing a valid warrant. In rejecting Johnson’s claim\nunder the Fifth Amendment, Johnson relied on AmeriSource\nCorporation v. United States, 525 F.3d 1149 (Fed. Cir. 2008).\nJohnson, 635 F.3d at 336. There, the government had “seized a\nlarge quantity” of pharmaceutical drugs from a plaintiff while\nexecuting a valid search warrant. AmeriSource Corp. v. United\nStates, 75 Fed. Cl. 743, 744 (2007). The plaintiff asked the gov-\nernment to return the drugs before they expired and lost their\nvalue, to no avail. AmeriSource, 525 F.3d at 1151–52. The Fed-\neral Circuit affirmed a decision by the Court of Federal Claims\nrejecting the plaintiff’s takings claim. Id. at 1157. The Federal\nCircuit observed that seizing property for “law enforcement\npurposes” is “a classic example of the government’s exercise\nof the police power to condemn contraband or noxious\ngoods,” which, the court concluded, is not a taking. Id. at 1153\n(quoting Acadia Technology, Inc. v. United States, 458 F.3d 1327,\n1332 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Thus, in context, Johnson does not nec-\nessarily foreclose takings claims outside the “classic example”\nof police power: exercising law-enforcement authority.\n\f12                                                    No. 24-2448\n\n    Perhaps Hadley’s argument means we will have some dif-\nficult cases in the future that will require us to consider John-\nson’s broader application. But this is not one of those cases.\nThe facts of Johnson are analogous to those at bar, and its re-\njection of compensation under the Takings Clause for dam-\nages to property during the execution of a lawful search war-\nrant remains good law. Hadley’s wholesale critique of John-\nson, based on the broadest imaginable reading of its language,\ndoes not warrant revisiting it.\n    This is not to say Hadley was without recourse entirely.\nShe could have sued police alleging they violated the Fourth\nAmendment by executing their search warrant unreasonably.\nE.g., Cybernet, LLC v. David, 954 F.3d 162, 168–69 (4th Cir.\n2020) (noting that “excessive or unnecessary destruction of\nproperty in the course of a search may violate the Fourth\nAmendment”). But she did not. And though she would have\nhad to overcome a qualified-immunity defense, that burden\nis not insurmountable. San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motor-\ncycle Club v. City of San Jose, 402 F.3d 962, 971–75 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(denying qualified immunity where officers cut down a mail-\nbox, jackhammered a sidewalk, and broke a refrigerator while\nexecuting a lawful warrant).\n    Bringing a claim like Hadley’s under the Takings Clause,\nrather than the Fourth Amendment, highlights deeper doctri-\nnal tensions. Since the Founding, courts have analyzed police\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment—not the Fifth. See\nCustomer Co. v. City of Sacramento, 10 Cal. 4th 368, 386–88\n(1995) (observing only two courts had awarded takings com-\npensation to property owners harmed by lawful police ac-\ntions under state, not federal, constitutional provisions).\nThese two amendments serve distinct purposes. The Fourth\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                    13\n\nAmendment, unlike the Fifth, is the constitutional bulwark\nagainst law enforcement invading the sanctity of the home.\nLange v. California, 594 U.S. 295, 309–10 (2021). The Fifth\nAmendment involves the government’s taking of property\nand allows for just compensation, something courts can de-\ncide with a degree of certainty. See Knick v. Twp. of Scott, 588\nU.S. 180, 191–94 (2019) (noting just compensation is owed im-\nmediately after a taking occurs and explaining methods of ob-\ntaining compensation). Both the government’s decision to\ntake property and a court’s adjudication of the property’s\nvalue can occur over an extended period, stretching years and\nallowing for a careful balancing of interests. E.g., United States\nv. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U.S. 121, 123–24 (1950) (dis-\ncussing how to value property taken).\n    In contrast, the Fourth Amendment does not require certi-\ntude. For example, law enforcement must show probable\ncause—requiring something more than “bare suspicion” but\nless than “proof of a crime”—to obtain a warrant and invade\none’s home lawfully. Rainsberger v. Benner, 913 F.3d 640, 648–\n49 (7th Cir. 2019) (Barrett, J.). And we analyze the execution\nof warrants in terms of reasonableness, eschewing rigid cate-\ngories and the carefully drawn balancing of interests. See\nUnited States v. Banks, 540 U.S. 31, 35–36 (2003) (observing in\nthe Fourth Amendment context that “no template is likely to\nproduce sounder results than examining the totality of cir-\ncumstances in a given case; it is too hard to invent categories\nwithout giving short shrift to details that turn out to be im-\nportant in a given instance, and without inflating marginal\nones”).\n   Nonetheless, Hadley sued under the Fifth Amendment,\nnot the Fourth. And Johnson forecloses her claim.\n\f14                                                 No. 24-2448\n\n     C. We have concerns about Hadley’s proposed holding.\n    As a reminder, Hadley urges us to hold that: “innocent\nhomeowner[s] with no connection to the sought-after sus-\npect[,] whose property the [government] intentionally and se-\nverely damage[s] through a military-style assault … to exe-\ncute a warrant to apprehend [a] suspect … when the property\notherwise would not have been damaged” are owed compen-\nsation.\n    Mindful of our decisions’ precedential effect on future\ncases, we have concerns about the administrability of Had-\nley’s proposed holding. It raises difficult questions, not least\nof which is, how does one determine innocence? For example,\nmust an ancillary criminal proceeding conclude to show in-\nnocence before proceeding with a takings claim? Does having\n“no connection” with a suspect—as Hadley asserted herself—\nrender the landowner “innocent”?\n    These questions highlight the problems with Hadley’s\nproposed holding. On the one hand, she urges us to impose a\nbright line: that a taking occurred simply because the govern-\nment damaged her property. But on the other hand, her pro-\nposed holding rests on fact-bound nuances and subtleties that\nwould be difficult to apply and are unaddressed by our prec-\nedent. Regardless, we need not consider Hadley’s proposed\ntest further, as we apply Johnson’s rule to affirm.\n\n                       III. Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\f",

Amy Hadley’s home was badly dam-\naged when local law enforcement executed a search warrant\nlooking for a fugitive they incorrectly believed was inside her\nhome. When both the City of South Bend and St. Joseph\nCounty declined to pay for the $16,000 in resulting damages,\nHadley sued for compensation under the Takings Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The district\ncourt dismissed her complaint, concluding that she failed to\n\f2                                                 No. 24-2448\n\nstate a claim, a decision she now appeals.

Background\n\n   The district court dismissed this case at the pleadings\nstage, so we accept the following well-pled allegations as true\non appeal. Emerson v. Dart, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">109 F.4th 936</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 941 (7th Cir. 2024).\n    Amy Hadley lives in South Bend, Indiana with her two\nchildren. In June 2022, local law enforcement believed a mur-\nder suspect, John Parnell Thomas, had (based on his IP ad-\ndress) accessed his Facebook account from within Hadley’s\nhome. Officers spent the evening surveilling Hadley’s house\nfrom afar but saw no sign of Thomas. The following day,\nhowever, someone again accessed the same Facebook account\nfrom the same IP address. Based on this information, officers\nobtained a lawful warrant to search Hadley’s home for\nThomas.\n    Warrant in hand, more law enforcement gathered outside\nthe home to execute it. Before entering, they demanded\nThomas exit, shouting their commands from outside using a\nbullhorn. Hadley’s fifteen-year-old son—the only person in\nthe home—surrendered. Hadley arrived at the scene before\nofficers entered her home. She professed to have no connec-\ntion with, or knowledge of, Thomas.\n   Officers were undeterred. Believing Thomas was in the\nhome and refusing to leave, they entered the house forcefully.\nThey broke windows and launched thirty cannisters of tear\ngas into the home. The gas destroyed all “porous” items in the\nhouse, like clothing and beds (Hadley had to sleep in her car\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   3\n\nfor days until toxic fumes from the gas dissipated). Police also\nwrecked internal security cameras, punched holes in the\nwalls, ransacked furniture and a closet, and tore down a panel\non a wall and a fan in a bathroom.\n    After the government refused to compensate Hadley for\nher damages, she sued defendants under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. §1983</span><pre class=\"inline\"> for\n$16,000. Relevant here, she argued the state officials violated\nher Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by taking her\nproperty (destroying it) “for public use” (while searching for\na fugitive) and thus owed her “just compensation.” See U.S.\nCONST. amends.

Analysis\n\n    Hadley sues via </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. §1983</span><pre class=\"inline\">, a procedural vehicle for\na plaintiff to seek damages from state officials who violate her\nconstitutional rights.

To state a claim under §1983, Hadley must show\n(among other things) that she was “deprived of a right\n\f4                                                   No. 24-2448\n\nsecured by the Constitution or federal law.” Thurman v. Vill.\nof Homewood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794178\"><a href=\"/opinion/794178/clifton-thurman-v-village-of-homewood-harry-boerema-curt-wiest/#687\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Clifton Thurman v. Village of Homewood, Harry Boerema,...\">446 F.3d 682, 687</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2006).\n    Hadley asserts her Fifth Amendment right to just compen-\nsation under the Takings Clause, applicable to the states\nthrough the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. The Takings Clause provides: “nor shall private prop-\nerty be taken for public use, without just compensation.” U.S.\nCONST. amend. V. Whether Hadley’s §1983 claim survives\ndismissal turns on whether the Fifth Amendment does in fact\nentitle her to compensation for the property damage police\ncaused while executing a valid warrant.\n    The district court, relying on Johnson, concluded the Fifth\nAmendment does not entitle her to compensation and dis-\nmissed the complaint. Hadley appeals, urging us to overrule\nJohnson and hold that: “innocent homeowner[s] with no con-\nnection to the sought-after suspect[,] whose property the\n[government] intentionally and severely damage[s] through a\nmilitary-style assault … to execute a warrant to apprehend [a]\nsuspect … when the property otherwise would not have been\ndamaged” deserve compensation under the Fifth Amend-\nment. Defendants, for their part, urge the opposite. They ask\nus to preserve and apply Johnson here to reject Hadley’s claim.\n   Because we agree that Johnson controls, we affirm. Under\nJohnson, the Fifth Amendment does not require the state to\ncompensate for property damage resulting from police exe-\ncuting a lawful search warrant. That is precisely what hap-\npened here: the damage Hadley suffered happened because\npolice executed a lawful search warrant in her home. Hadley\ncannot escape Johnson’s application in this case by arguing\nthere is some other set of facts that should compel us to revisit\nJohnson. We may face difficult questions regarding the\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   5\n\napplication of the Takings Clause in future cases. That does\nnothing to change the fact that Johnson’s application to dam-\nage caused when local officials execute a valid search warrant\nis both clear and controlling. Thus, we affirm the district\ncourt’s order dismissing Hadley’s complaint.\n    We proceed in three steps. First, we explain that Johnson\ncontrols and requires us to affirm. Second, we explain Had-\nley’s contrary arguments and conclude that they do not cast\ndoubt that Johnson controls here. Third, we briefly explain\nthat—even setting Johnson aside—we have serious doubts\nabout Hadley’s proposed holding.\n   A. Johnson, which addressed facts nearly identical to\n      Hadley’s, controls and requires us to aﬃrm.\n    This Court decided Johnson in 2011. There, the plaintiff\n(Johnson), like Hadley, suffered significant property damage\nwhile police executed a valid warrant.\n    Johnson owned a trailer and garage on a rural lot in Wis-\nconsin.

Hadley presents no grounds to overturn Johnson.\n    If this case presented a claim outside the context of police\nexecuting a lawful search warrant, we might need to grapple\nwith more of Hadley’s arguments. But it does not. Johnson set-\ntled the issue here: whether the Takings Clause applies when\npolice damage property while executing a lawful search war-\nrant. Johnson forecloses a takings claim under these circum-\nstances, and Hadley gives us no reason to set that holding\naside.\n    We could end with this straightforward analysis showing\nJohnson controls. Yet Hadley makes some sound observations\nabout our takings analysis in Johnson—abbreviated as it was,\nbecause Johnson’s primary claim arose under the Fourth\nAmendment—and highlights some issues we may need to\ngrapple with in future cases. Understanding Hadley’s argu-\nment requires some background. The “police power” refers to\na state’s general authority “to determine, primarily, what\nmeasures are appropriate or needful for the protection of the\npublic morals, the public health, or the public safety.” Mugler\nv.

The first is called a “per se” taking; the sec-\nond is called a “regulatory taking.” Cedar Point Nursery, 594\nU.S. at 149. A regulatory taking may occur when the state ex-\nercises its police power to regulate how one uses property. Id.\nThat said, “[w]henever a regulation results in a physical ap-\npropriation of property, a per se taking has occurred.” Id.\n     One way a government exercises its police power is when\nit investigates criminal activity. See id. at 160–61. But the Court\nhas held the Fifth Amendment does not apply when a\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                   9\n\ngovernment takes property by asserting a “pre-existing limi-\ntation upon the landowner’s title.” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1028–29.\nThese limitations include “traditional common law privi-\nleges” like the “privilege to enter property to effect an arrest\nor enforce the criminal law under certain circumstances.” Ce-\ndar Point, 594 U.S. at 160–61. As such, “government searches\nthat are consistent with the Fourth Amendment and state law\ncannot be said to take any property right from landowners.”\nId. at 161.\n    For example, in Bennis, the Court held that lawfully seiz-\ning a vehicle through civil forfeiture after a criminal investi-\ngation is not a taking under the Fifth Amendment. Bennis, 516\nU.S. at 452–53. There, the state seized a car after one of the\ncar’s owners, the husband, “engaged in sexual activity with a\nprostitute” inside the car. Id. at 443. The Court declined to\naward compensation to the other owner (the wife) for the\nauto’s seizure because the state lawfully seized the car as an\ninstrumentality of a crime. Id. at 452–53. No taking occurred,\nthe Court reasoned, because the state “already lawfully ac-\nquired [the car] under the exercise of governmental authority\nother than the power of eminent domain.” Id. at 452.\n     Several of our sister circuits have recently considered\nwhether a taking occurs when a state damages property while\nexercising its law-enforcement powers. E.g., Baker v. City of\nMcKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">84 F.4th 378</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2023) (analyzing whether a\ntaking occurred when police damaged a plaintiff’s home dur-\ning a standoff with an armed fugitive), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">145 S.

City of Los Angeles,\nNo. 24-2422 (9th Cir. 2025), oral argument heard (Jan. 16, 2025)\n(raising whether a business owner may bring a takings claim\nfor damage to his shop caused when police sought to appre-\nhend a fugitive). But so far, no circuit to consider this issue\nhas awarded a plaintiff compensation. Nonetheless, two pre-\nsent Justices recently expressed interest in this issue. In their\nwords, whether a taking occurs when law enforcement dam-\nages property remains an “open question … that would ben-\nefit from further percolation” in the courts of appeals. Baker,\n145 S. Ct. at 13 (Sotomayor, J., statement respecting denial of\ncertiorari, joined by Gorsuch, J.).\n    With this controversy in hand, Hadley prods us to enter\nthis debate anew. She urges us to abandon Johnson because it\nsuggested the Takings Clause categorically does not apply\nwhen a government exercises its police powers. She says this\ndistinction does not match recent Supreme Court precedent,\nwhich recognizes that a state may impose a taking when it\nexercises its police power to, for example, regulate a land use.\nYee, 503 U.S. at 522–23. Because she says Johnson impermissi-\nbly forecloses any takings claim arising from a state using its\npolice power writ large, she insists that Johnson must be over-\nruled.\n   We see things differently. As noted above, Johnson staked\nour Circuit’s position on the specific issue in Hadley’s case—\nwhether the Fifth Amendment requires compensation when\npolice damage property while executing a valid search war-\nrant. The answer is no. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"206457\"><a href=\"/opinion/206457/johnson-v-manitowoc-county/#336\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Johnson v. Manitowoc County\">635 F.3d at 336</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. And, as dis-\ncussed above, Johnson’s application in the law-enforcement\ncontext is well supported by precedent from our sister circuits\nand the Supreme Court. Hadley points us to no authority\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                    11\n\nshowing this position is categorically wrong. Accordingly, we\nneed not decide whether Johnson governs outside Hadley’s\ncontext. “[J]udicial opinions are not statutes,” and thus “[i]t is\nalways important to understand opinions in light of their\nholdings and not take ambiguous statements for all they\nmight be worth.” Vinning-El v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613743\"><a href=\"/opinion/613743/vinning-el-v-evans/#595\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Vinning-El v. Evans\">657 F.3d 591, 595</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 2011). We adjudicate the case before us and “general ex-\npressions must be read in light of the subject under consider-\nation.” Lewis v. Zatecky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">993 F.3d 994</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1003 (7th Cir. 2021)\n(quoting United States v.

Skoien\">614 F.3d 638, 640</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir.\n2010) (en banc)).\n    Indeed, Johnson itself suggests its holding might not apply\noutside of the context of law enforcement damaging property\nwhile executing a valid warrant. In rejecting Johnson’s claim\nunder the Fifth Amendment, Johnson relied on AmeriSource\nCorporation v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"209931\"><a href=\"/opinion/209931/amerisource-corp-v-united-states/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: AmeriSource Corp. v.

Cir. 2008).\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"206457\"><a href=\"/opinion/206457/johnson-v-manitowoc-county/#336\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Johnson v. Manitowoc County\">635 F.3d at 336</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, the government had “seized a\nlarge quantity” of pharmaceutical drugs from a plaintiff while\nexecuting a valid search warrant. AmeriSource Corp. v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6655941\"><a href=\"/opinion/6772904/amerisource-corp-v-united-states/#744\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: AmeriSource Corp. v. United States\">75 Fed. Cl. 743, 744</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007). The plaintiff asked the gov-\nernment to return the drugs before they expired and lost their\nvalue, to no avail. AmeriSource, 525 F.3d at 1151–52. The Fed-\neral Circuit affirmed a decision by the Court of Federal Claims\nrejecting the plaintiff’s takings claim. Id. at 1157. The Federal\nCircuit observed that seizing property for “law enforcement\npurposes” is “a classic example of the government’s exercise\nof the police power to condemn contraband or noxious\ngoods,” which, the court concluded, is not a taking. Id. at 1153\n(quoting Acadia Technology, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"211127\"><a href=\"/opinion/211127/acadia-technology-inc-v-united-states/#1332\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Acadia Technology, Inc. v. United States\">458 F.3d 1327,\n1332</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Thus, in context, Johnson does not nec-\nessarily foreclose takings claims outside the “classic example”\nof police power: exercising law-enforcement authority.\n\f12                                                    No. 24-2448\n\n    Perhaps Hadley’s argument means we will have some dif-\nficult cases in the future that will require us to consider John-\nson’s broader application. But this is not one of those cases.\nThe facts of Johnson are analogous to those at bar, and its re-\njection of compensation under the Takings Clause for dam-\nages to property during the execution of a lawful search war-\nrant remains good law. Hadley’s wholesale critique of John-\nson, based on the broadest imaginable reading of its language,\ndoes not warrant revisiting it.\n    This is not to say Hadley was without recourse entirely.\nShe could have sued police alleging they violated the Fourth\nAmendment by executing their search warrant unreasonably.\nE.g., Cybernet, LLC v. David, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">954 F.3d 162</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168–69 (4th Cir.\n2020) (noting that “excessive or unnecessary destruction of\nproperty in the course of a search may violate the Fourth\nAmendment”). But she did not. And though she would have\nhad to overcome a qualified-immunity defense, that burden\nis not insurmountable. San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motor-\ncycle Club v. City of San Jose, </pre><span class=\"citation multiple-matches\"><a href=\"/c/F.3d/402/962/\">402 F.3d 962</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971–75 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(denying qualified immunity where officers cut down a mail-\nbox, jackhammered a sidewalk, and broke a refrigerator while\nexecuting a lawful warrant).\n    Bringing a claim like Hadley’s under the Takings Clause,\nrather than the Fourth Amendment, highlights deeper doctri-\nnal tensions. Since the Founding, courts have analyzed police\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment—not the Fifth. See\nCustomer Co. v. City of Sacramento, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9846524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265746/customer-co-v-city-of-sacramento/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Customer Co. v. City of Sacramento\">10 Cal. 4th 368</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386–88\n(1995) (observing only two courts had awarded takings com-\npensation to property owners harmed by lawful police ac-\ntions under state, not federal, constitutional provisions).\nThese two amendments serve distinct purposes. The Fourth\n\fNo. 24-2448                                                    13\n\nAmendment, unlike the Fifth, is the constitutional bulwark\nagainst law enforcement invading the sanctity of the home.\nLange v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">594 U.S. 295</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309–10 (2021). The Fifth\nAmendment involves the government’s taking of property\nand allows for just compensation, something courts can de-\ncide with a degree of certainty. See Knick v. Twp. of Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">588\nU.S. 180</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191–94 (2019) (noting just compensation is owed im-\nmediately after a taking occurs and explaining methods of ob-\ntaining compensation). Both the government’s decision to\ntake property and a court’s adjudication of the property’s\nvalue can occur over an extended period, stretching years and\nallowing for a careful balancing of interests. E.g., United States\nv. Commodities Trading Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9420450\"><a href=\"/opinion/104774/united-states-v-commodities-trading-corp/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Commodities Trading Corp.\">339 U.S. 121</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123–24 (1950) (dis-\ncussing how to value property taken).\n    In contrast, the Fourth Amendment does not require certi-\ntude. For example, law enforcement must show probable\ncause—requiring something more than “bare suspicion” but\nless than “proof of a crime”—to obtain a warrant and invade\none’s home lawfully. Rainsberger v. Benner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8415273\"><a href=\"/opinion/8443847/rainsberger-v-benner/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Rainsberger v. Benner\">913 F.3d 640</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648–\n49 (7th Cir. 2019) (Barrett, J.). And we analyze the execution\nof warrants in terms of reasonableness, eschewing rigid cate-\ngories and the carefully drawn balancing of interests. See\nUnited States v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131146\"><a href=\"/opinion/131146/united-states-v-banks/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Banks\">540 U.S. 31</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35–36 (2003) (observing in\nthe Fourth Amendment context that “no template is likely to\nproduce sounder results than examining the totality of cir-\ncumstances in a given case; it is too hard to invent categories\nwithout giving short shrift to details that turn out to be im-\nportant in a given instance, and without inflating marginal\nones”).\n   Nonetheless, Hadley sued under the Fifth Amendment,\nnot the Fourth. And Johnson forecloses her claim.\n\f14                                                 No. 24-2448\n\n     C. We have concerns about Hadley’s proposed holding.\n    As a reminder, Hadley urges us to hold that: “innocent\nhomeowner[s] with no connection to the sought-after sus-\npect[,] whose property the [government] intentionally and se-\nverely damage[s] through a military-style assault … to exe-\ncute a warrant to apprehend [a] suspect … when the property\notherwise would not have been damaged” are owed compen-\nsation.\n    Mindful of our decisions’ precedential effect on future\ncases, we have concerns about the administrability of Had-\nley’s proposed holding. It raises difficult questions, not least\nof which is, how does one determine innocence? For example,\nmust an ancillary criminal proceeding conclude to show in-\nnocence before proceeding with a takings claim? Does having\n“no connection” with a suspect—as Hadley asserted herself—\nrender the landowner “innocent”?\n    These questions highlight the problems with Hadley’s\nproposed holding. On the one hand, she urges us to impose a\nbright line: that a taking occurred simply because the govern-\nment damaged her property. But on the other hand, her pro-\nposed holding rests on fact-bound nuances and subtleties that\nwould be difficult to apply and are unaddressed by our prec-\nedent. Regardless, we need not consider Hadley’s proposed\ntest further, as we apply Johnson’s rule to affirm.\n\n                       III. Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\f</pre>",

Regions, a previous trustee for the trusts, was permitted to resign\nin October 2010. In February 2011, Castellarin was named successor trustee. Beginning\nin 2015, Meersman filed lawsuits alleging mismanagement of the trusts by Defendants. In\nJuly 2023, Meersman’s partner, Rumsey, sued Defendants in the Trial Court. Rumsey was\nnot a beneficiary of the trusts. However, Rumsey alleged that Defendants’ mismanagement\nof the trusts led to severe hardship for Meersman, which in turn damaged Rumsey.\nSpecifically, Rumsey alleged loss of consortium, intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy, and negligence. In response,\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6). On January 31,\n2024, the Trial Court entered an order granting Defendants’ motions. The Trial Court ruled\nthat Rumsey’s loss of consortium claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations\nfound at Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-3-104;2 that Rumsey’s claims of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligence were barred\nby the three-year statute of limitations found at Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-3-105; and that\nRumsey’s claim of conspiracy was a claim of injury to property and therefore was also\nbarred by the three-year statute of limitations. The Trial Court awarded Regions attorney’s\nfees and costs under Tenn. Code Ann. § 20-12-119(c), subject to the exhaustion of appeals.\n\n       On March 1, 2024, Rumsey filed a motion to alter or amend. Rumsey was still\nproceeding pro se at this juncture. Rumsey’s motion was stamped “fax-filed” in the Trial\nCourt. The motion contained no certificate of service. As to the substance of Rumsey’s\nmotion, Rumsey argued that a ten-year statute of limitations applied to her claims and thus\nthey were timely. Rumsey also sought leave to file an amended complaint. Rumsey then\nretained counsel. On May 13, 2024, Rumsey’s counsel filed a notice of appearance.\nMeanwhile, Defendants filed responses in opposition to Rumsey’s motion. Regions\nattached to its response the sworn declaration of its counsel, Lisa K. Helton, stating that on\nMarch 4, 2024, Meersman emailed her a copy of Rumsey’s motion to alter or amend; that\nto her knowledge neither she nor any one at her firm received any copies of the motion\nprior to March 4, 2024; and that Rumsey did not serve notice of the filing through the\ncourt’s e-filing system. Attached to this declaration was an image of Meersman’s email\nwith attached PDF files titled “Motion to Alter Leave to File first Amend Complaint\nCertificate of Service,” “Motion for leave of filing first amendend [sic] complaint,” “IN\nTHE CHANCERY COURT FOR THE STATE OF TENNESSEE,” and “Motion to alter\n2\n The Trial Court additionally ruled that Rumsey’s loss of consortium claim must be dismissed since she\nwas not married to Meersman. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 25-1-106 (“There shall exist in cases where such\ndamages are proved by a spouse, a right to recover for loss of consortium.”).\n                                                  -2-\n\for amend Laila.”3 On March 4, 2024, Rumsey purported to correct her omission of a\ncertificate of service, filing an “amended complaint loss of consortium” and a certificate of\nservice with respect to her motion to alter or amend judgment. The certificate of service\nread: “I hereby certify that on the 4th day of March, 2024, a true and correct copy of the\nforegoing Motion to Alter or Amend Judgement, Amended Complaint Loss of Consortium,\nleave to file First Amended Complaint was sent by fax upon [Defendants’ counsel].”\n\n        On May 20, 2024, the Trial Court entered an order denying Rumsey’s motions to\nalter and amend and motion for leave to file first amended complaint. The Trial Court\nstated, as relevant: “The Court finds the Motions are not well taken. Plaintiff failed to\ntimely serve the Motions on Defendants as required by Rule 59.04. Further, Plaintiff\nattempts to raise new theories and legal arguments that were not previously argued or raised\nin the original Complaint.” On June 20, 2024, Rumsey filed a notice of appeal in this\nCourt.\n\n                                                Discussion\n\n        Although not stated exactly as such, Rumsey raises the issue of whether a ten-year\nstatute of limitations applies to her claims. Defendants assert that Rumsey’s appeal must\nbe dismissed for untimeliness, which is dispositive. We agree. Defendants further contend\nthat this appeal is frivolous.\n\n         The dispositive issue, whether Rumsey’s failure to timely serve Defendants with\nher motion to alter or amend renders this appeal untimely, concerns the interpretation of\ncourt rules. We have discussed the standard of review for such questions thusly:\n\n          In construing a statute or rule, our primary purpose is to give effect to the\n          purpose of the legislature. The interpretation of rules and statutes involve\n          questions of law which appellate courts review de novo without a\n          presumption of correctness.

R. Civ. P. 59.02; Tenn. R. App. P. 4(a)-(b). If timely, certain post-\n       trial motions, such as Defendants’ motion to alter or amend, will toll\n       commencement of the thirty-day period for filing a notice of appeal until the\n       trial court enters an order granting or denying the motion.

McAllister v. Goode,\n968 S.W.2d 834, 840 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997)).\n\n       Regarding those motions which toll the time for appeal, Tenn. R. App. P. 4(b) states:\n\n       (b) Termination by Specified Timely Motions in Civil Actions. In a civil\n       action, if a timely motion under the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure is\n       filed in the trial court by any party: (1) under Rule 50.02 for judgment in\n       accordance with a motion for a directed verdict; (2) under Rule 52.02 to\n       amend or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of the\n       judgment would be required if the motion is granted; (3) under Rule 59.07\n       for a new trial; (4) under Rule 59.04 to alter or amend the judgment; the time\n       for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying a new\n       trial or granting or denying any other such motion.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 4(b). With respect to the type of motion at issue in the appeal at bar, a\nmotion to alter or amend, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 provides: “A motion to alter or amend a\njudgment shall be filed and served within thirty (30) days after the entry of the judgment.”\n\n        On January 31, 2024, the Trial Court granted Defendants’ motions to dismiss. The\nTrial Court found that each of Rumsey’s claims was time-barred based on the applicable\nstatute of limitations. There was nothing else for the Trial Court to decide after this. Thus,\n                                              -4-\n\fthe January 31, 2024 order constituted a final judgment. Rumsey had thirty days from\nentry of the January 31, 2024 order in which to file a notice of appeal with this Court or\nfile in the Trial Court one of the motions provided by the rules which serve to toll the time\nto appeal. Rumsey chose the latter course and filed a motion to alter or amend. It is\nundisputed that Rumsey timely filed her motion to alter or amend on March 1, 2024.\nHowever, Rumsey did not serve Defendants until March 4, 2024, which was more than\nthirty days from entry of the final judgment. According to Defendants, under the authority\nof Ball, Rumsey’s motion to alter or amend was not timely and did not serve to toll her\ntime to file a notice of appeal.\n\n       In response, Rumsey points out that Ball featured a different scenario than that of\nthe present case. In Ball, two judgments were at issue. 288 S.W.3d at 836. If the second\njudgment was the final judgment, the defendants’ motion to alter or amend would have\nbeen timely. Id. If the first judgment was the final judgment, the defendants’ motion would\nhave been untimely, as it was filed more than thirty days after the first judgment’s entry.\nId. The High Court found the first judgment was final and that the defendants’ motion to\nalter or amend was untimely. Id. at 837. The Ball Court concluded that the trial court\nlacked jurisdiction to rule on the motion, and that the Court of Appeals likewise lacked\njurisdiction. Id. Thus, Ball concerned a motion to alter or amend that was not timely filed.\nHere, while Rumsey failed to timely serve her motion, she timely filed it. According to\nRumsey, nothing in Ball stands for the proposition that a motion to alter or amend that is\nuntimely served will not toll the time in which a litigant may file a notice of appeal. We\nhave found no Tennessee case directly on point.\n\n        While Ball does not address the exact scenario before us, it does state that “[i]f a\npost-trial motion is not timely, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the motion.” 288\nS.W.3d at 836. We therefore look to whether Rumsey’s motion was timely. The language\nof Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 is mandatory: “A motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be\nfiled and served within thirty (30) days after the entry of the judgment.” (Emphasis added).\nWords have meaning, and we are not at liberty to ignore the language of the Rule as written\nby the Tennessee Supreme Court. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 is clear that a motion to alter or\namend must be both filed and served within thirty days after the entry of judgment to be\ntimely. The conjunctive use of the word “and” is significant. No distinction is made in the\nrule as to the necessity of both timely filing and serving the motion; both must be done\nwithin thirty days of the entry of judgment. We will not infer a distinction that is not in the\nplain language of the Rule. Therefore, we conclude that under a plain reading of Tenn. R.\nCiv. P. 59.04, a motion to alter or amend that is not both filed and served within thirty days\nafter the entry of the judgment is untimely and does not serve to toll the time in which a\nlitigant may file a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f        In the present matter, Defendants were served with Rumsey’s motion to alter or\namend on March 4, 2024, more than thirty days from the entry of judgment on January 31,\n2024. Rumsey filed her notice of appeal with this Court on June 20, 2024, well beyond\nthirty days from the entry of judgment. As Rumsey’s notice of appeal was untimely filed,\nwe lack jurisdiction to consider her appeal. This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n        The final issue we address is Defendants’ issue of whether Rumsey’s appeal is\nfrivolous. Defendants request costs and expenses for defending against what they contend\nis a frivolous appeal. Tenn. Code Ann. § 27-1-122 provides:\n\n       When it appears to any reviewing court that the appeal from any court of\n       record was frivolous or taken solely for delay, the court may, either upon\n       motion of a party or of its own motion, award just damages against the\n       appellant, which may include, but need not be limited to, costs, interest on\n       the judgment, and expenses incurred by the appellee as a result of the appeal.\n\n“‘A frivolous appeal is one that is ‘devoid of merit,’ or one in which there is little prospect\nthat [an appeal] can ever succeed.’” Morton v. Morton, 182 S.W.3d 821, 838 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2005) (quoting Industrial Dev. Bd. of the City of Tullahoma v. Hancock, 901 S.W.2d\n382, 385 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995)). Exercising our discretion, we decline to find Rumsey’s\nappeal frivolous or to award Defendants any costs or expenses.\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n      The appeal is dismissed for untimeliness, and this cause is remanded to the Trial\nCourt for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed against the\nAppellant, Laila Rumsey, and her surety, if any.\n\n\n                                           ____________________________________\n                                           D.

Meersman has filed multiple lawsuits against former\ntrustees Michael Castellarin (“Castellarin”) and Regions Bank (“Regions”) (“Defendants,”\ncollectively) alleging that they mismanaged the trusts. The trusts were terminated by court\norder in 2015. Laila Rumsey (“Rumsey”), Meersman’s partner, sued Defendants in the\nChancery Court for Davidson County (“the Trial Court”) alleging that she too was damaged\nby Defendants’ actions. Defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the Trial Court granted\nbased on the statute of limitations. Rumsey filed a motion to alter or amend within thirty\ndays of entry of judgment but, contrary to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 59.04, did\nnot serve Defendants within thirty days. The Trial Court denied Rumsey’s motion as\nuntimely. Rumsey appeals. Rule 59.04 requires such a motion be both “filed and served”\nwithin thirty days of entry of judgment. Rumsey failed to serve Defendants timely.\nTherefore, Rumsey’s motion to alter or amend was untimely and did not toll the time in\nwhich to file a notice of appeal. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Appeal Dismissed\n\nD.

Murphy, Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellee,\nMichael Castellarin.\n\nLisa K. Helton and Alice E.

Regions, a previous trustee for the trusts, was permitted to resign\nin October 2010. In February 2011, Castellarin was named successor trustee. Beginning\nin 2015, Meersman filed lawsuits alleging mismanagement of the trusts by Defendants. In\nJuly 2023, Meersman’s partner, Rumsey, sued Defendants in the Trial Court. Rumsey was\nnot a beneficiary of the trusts. However, Rumsey alleged that Defendants’ mismanagement\nof the trusts led to severe hardship for Meersman, which in turn damaged Rumsey.\nSpecifically, Rumsey alleged loss of consortium, intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy, and negligence. In response,\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6). On January 31,\n2024, the Trial Court entered an order granting Defendants’ motions. The Trial Court ruled\nthat Rumsey’s loss of consortium claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations\nfound at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-3-104</span><pre class=\"inline\">;2 that Rumsey’s claims of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligence were barred\nby the three-year statute of limitations found at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-3-105</span><pre class=\"inline\">; and that\nRumsey’s claim of conspiracy was a claim of injury to property and therefore was also\nbarred by the three-year statute of limitations. The Trial Court awarded Regions attorney’s\nfees and costs under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code Ann. § 20-12-119</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c), subject to the exhaustion of appeals.\n\n       On March 1, 2024, Rumsey filed a motion to alter or amend. Rumsey was still\nproceeding pro se at this juncture. Rumsey’s motion was stamped “fax-filed” in the Trial\nCourt. The motion contained no certificate of service. As to the substance of Rumsey’s\nmotion, Rumsey argued that a ten-year statute of limitations applied to her claims and thus\nthey were timely. Rumsey also sought leave to file an amended complaint. Rumsey then\nretained counsel. On May 13, 2024, Rumsey’s counsel filed a notice of appearance.\nMeanwhile, Defendants filed responses in opposition to Rumsey’s motion. Regions\nattached to its response the sworn declaration of its counsel, Lisa K. Helton, stating that on\nMarch 4, 2024, Meersman emailed her a copy of Rumsey’s motion to alter or amend; that\nto her knowledge neither she nor any one at her firm received any copies of the motion\nprior to March 4, 2024; and that Rumsey did not serve notice of the filing through the\ncourt’s e-filing system. Attached to this declaration was an image of Meersman’s email\nwith attached PDF files titled “Motion to Alter Leave to File first Amend Complaint\nCertificate of Service,” “Motion for leave of filing first amendend [sic] complaint,” “IN\nTHE CHANCERY COURT FOR THE STATE OF TENNESSEE,” and “Motion to alter\n2\n The Trial Court additionally ruled that Rumsey’s loss of consortium claim must be dismissed since she\nwas not married to Meersman. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code Ann. § 25-1-106</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“There shall exist in cases where such\ndamages are proved by a spouse, a right to recover for loss of consortium.”).\n                                                  -2-\n\for amend Laila.”3 On March 4, 2024, Rumsey purported to correct her omission of a\ncertificate of service, filing an “amended complaint loss of consortium” and a certificate of\nservice with respect to her motion to alter or amend judgment. The certificate of service\nread: “I hereby certify that on the 4th day of March, 2024, a true and correct copy of the\nforegoing Motion to Alter or Amend Judgement, Amended Complaint Loss of Consortium,\nleave to file First Amended Complaint was sent by fax upon [Defendants’ counsel].”\n\n        On May 20, 2024, the Trial Court entered an order denying Rumsey’s motions to\nalter and amend and motion for leave to file first amended complaint. The Trial Court\nstated, as relevant: “The Court finds the Motions are not well taken. Plaintiff failed to\ntimely serve the Motions on Defendants as required by Rule 59.04. Further, Plaintiff\nattempts to raise new theories and legal arguments that were not previously argued or raised\nin the original Complaint.” On June 20, 2024, Rumsey filed a notice of appeal in this\nCourt.\n\n                                                Discussion\n\n        Although not stated exactly as such, Rumsey raises the issue of whether a ten-year\nstatute of limitations applies to her claims. Defendants assert that Rumsey’s appeal must\nbe dismissed for untimeliness, which is dispositive. We agree. Defendants further contend\nthat this appeal is frivolous.\n\n         The dispositive issue, whether Rumsey’s failure to timely serve Defendants with\nher motion to alter or amend renders this appeal untimely, concerns the interpretation of\ncourt rules. We have discussed the standard of review for such questions thusly:\n\n          In construing a statute or rule, our primary purpose is to give effect to the\n          purpose of the legislature. The interpretation of rules and statutes involve\n          questions of law which appellate courts review de novo without a\n          presumption of correctness. In reaching our interpretation of a statute or rule,\n          we look first to the plain language of the enactments, giving the words their\n          ordinary and plain meaning.\n\nSteinberg v.

The Ball Court concluded that the trial court\nlacked jurisdiction to rule on the motion, and that the Court of Appeals likewise lacked\njurisdiction. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1632208\"><a href=\"/opinion/1632208/ball-v-mcdowell/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Ball v. McDowell\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Thus, Ball concerned a motion to alter or amend that was not timely filed.\nHere, while Rumsey failed to timely serve her motion, she timely filed it. According to\nRumsey, nothing in Ball stands for the proposition that a motion to alter or amend that is\nuntimely served will not toll the time in which a litigant may file a notice of appeal. We\nhave found no Tennessee case directly on point.\n\n        While Ball does not address the exact scenario before us, it does state that “[i]f a\npost-trial motion is not timely, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the motion.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1632208\"><a href=\"/opinion/1632208/ball-v-mcdowell/#836\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Ball v. McDowell\">288\nS.W.3d at 836</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. We therefore look to whether Rumsey’s motion was timely. The language\nof Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 is mandatory: “A motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be\nfiled and served within thirty (30) days after the entry of the judgment.” (Emphasis added).\nWords have meaning, and we are not at liberty to ignore the language of the Rule as written\nby the Tennessee Supreme Court. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 is clear that a motion to alter or\namend must be both filed and served within thirty days after the entry of judgment to be\ntimely. The conjunctive use of the word “and” is significant. No distinction is made in the\nrule as to the necessity of both timely filing and serving the motion; both must be done\nwithin thirty days of the entry of judgment. We will not infer a distinction that is not in the\nplain language of the Rule. Therefore, we conclude that under a plain reading of Tenn. R.\nCiv. P. 59.04, a motion to alter or amend that is not both filed and served within thirty days\nafter the entry of the judgment is untimely and does not serve to toll the time in which a\nlitigant may file a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f        In the present matter, Defendants were served with Rumsey’s motion to alter or\namend on March 4, 2024, more than thirty days from the entry of judgment on January 31,\n2024. Rumsey filed her notice of appeal with this Court on June 20, 2024, well beyond\nthirty days from the entry of judgment. As Rumsey’s notice of appeal was untimely filed,\nwe lack jurisdiction to consider her appeal. This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n        The final issue we address is Defendants’ issue of whether Rumsey’s appeal is\nfrivolous. Defendants request costs and expenses for defending against what they contend\nis a frivolous appeal. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn.

Appeal from order (same court and Justice), entered on or about June 17, 2024, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p>This appeal represents the latest in a long-running dispute between plaintiff Kenneth Rosenblum and the estate of his deceased mother, defendant Bernice Rosenblum, who together owned equal interests in various entities that held rental properties in Manhattan, including 132 Realty LLC and Village Realty LLC (the LLCs) and Standard Realty Associates, Inc. (Standard), which managed the entities and properties.</p>\n<p>Contrary to plaintiff's contentions, the trial court correctly applied a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) to the value of his membership interests in the LLCs (<i>see Matter of Giaimo v Vitale</i>, 101 AD3d 523 [1st Dept 2012]). The determination of fair value rests on \"[I]n fixing fair value, courts should determine the minority shareholder's proportionate interest in the value of the corporation as a whole, that is, what a willing purchaser, in an arm's length transaction, would offer for the corporation as an operating business (Matter<i> of Friedman v Beway Realty Corp.</i> (87 NY2d 161, 168 [1995]; <i>see also Blake v Blake Agency</i>, 107 AD2d 139, 146 [2d Dept 1985]). The next step is to calculate the DLOM (<i>see id.</i> at 170-171). It is \"not an exact science, and it is the 'particular facts and circumstances' of each case that will dictate the result\" (<i>Giaimo,</i> 101 AD3d at 524], quoting <i>Beway</i>, 87 NY2d at 167]).</p>\n<p>Based on the record before the trial court, its choice to credit defendants' business valuation expert over plaintiff's \"can 'be reached under a[] fair interpretation of the evidence'\" (<i>Matter of Levine v Seven Pines Assoc. L.P.</i>,156 AD3d 524, 525 [1st Dept 2017][internal citation omitted]). Namely, defendants' expert's conclusion relied on the protracted litigation between the parties, the lack of an operating agreement setting forth a process for withdrawal and the amount of time and money spent on \"an unwillingness to compromise,\" all of which highlights the difficulties a third-party investor would risk in purchasing the LLCs and supports the DLOM applied (<i>see generally Giaimo</i>, 101 AD3d 523). Conversely, plaintiff failed to submit any evidence supporting the value of a DLOM, maintaining instead that no discount should apply.</p>\n<p>While plaintiff's expert concluded, alternatively, that the DLOM should be 3-5%, plaintiff failed to make this argument or rely on this conclusion in his post-trial brief. As noted, plaintiff continued to maintain that the DLOM must be zero. Therefore, his current contention \"is improperly raised for the first time on appeal\" (<i>International Mdse. Group Ams. v Segerman Intl.,</i> 277 AD2d 168 [1st Dept 2000]).</p>\n<p>Next, the trial court rejected defendant's argument that loans Standard owed to the LLCs should be eliminated from the valuation calculation because of Standard's purported insolvency. Plaintiff does not contest this conclusion on appeal, but instead maintains that Standard's outstanding loans must be reduced by the 15% DLOM applied to plaintiff's share of the LLCs. This position is also \"improperly raised for the first time on appeal\" (<i>International Mdse. Group Ams.</i>, 277 AD2d 168), and is in any event rejected. The trial court correctly applied the DLOM against the aggregate net asset value of the LLCs (<i>see Beway</i>, 87 NY2d at 166). That Standard and the LLCs have the same partners and members, respectively, does not affect each entities' books and records. To that end, the LLCs' loans receivable have no bearing on the loans payable by Standard, a completely separate and distinct entity.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's contention that the court should have awarded him interest on the value of his membership interests pursuant to CPLR 5001(a) is precluded by our decision on the prior appeal in this action (<i>Rosenblum v Rosenblum</i>, 214 AD3d 440 [1st Dept 2023]) (<i>see Apollo Asset Mgt., Inc. v Cernich,</i> 226 AD3d 466 [1st Dept 2024]). Plaintiff's alternative argument that he should retain post-withdrawal distributions from the LLCs is unavailing. There is simply no connection between CPLR 5001 interest and post-withdrawal distributions from the LLCs that would warrant such a result.</p>\n<p>Defendants contend that plaintiff waived his right to CPLR 5002 interest because he did not include it in his proposed judgment. However, \"[i]nterest under CPLR 5002 . . . is not dependent upon . . . a specific demand\" (<i>Matter of Doman,</i> 150 AD3d 994, 996 [2d Dept 2017] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Plaintiff \"was entitled to [CPLR 5002] interest regardless of whether [it was] specifically provided for in the judgment\" (<i>NYCTL 1998-2 Trust v Wagner</i> (61 AD3d 728 [2d Dept 2009]).</p>\n<p>The reference to a \"decision\" in CPLR 5002 \"typically refers to the date that liability, as distinguished from damages, is established\" (Hon. Mark C. Dillon, Prac Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C5002:1). Therefore, interest here should run from June 14, 2024, the date of the underlying order, not July 19, 2024, the date on which the court signed the judgment.</p>\n<p>Defendants are not entitled to their own award of interest based on the (1) money Standard borrowed and that plaintiff is obligated to repay; and (2) distributions plaintiff received after he withdrew from the LLCs. First, this argument relies on CPLR 5001(a) rather than 5002, and as explained above plaintiff is not entitled to interest under the former. As for CPLR 5002, only plaintiff is entitled to interest under that since he was awarded a sum to which an award of interest could be applied.</p>\n<p>Finally, we reject defendants' contention on their cross-appeal that the court should have used their expert's capitalization rate rather than plaintiff's. The court's choice of plaintiff's expert's rate \"can be reached under a fair interpretation of the evidence\" (<i>Levine,</i> 156 AD3d at 525 [brackets and internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see also Underbruckner Realty Corp. v Tax Commn. of the City of N.Y.,</i> 94 AD3d 527, 527 [1st Dept 2012] [\"whether the . . . buildings relied upon by petitioners were valid 'comparables' was a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court\"]; <i>Matter of George A. Donaldson &amp; Sons, Inc. v Assessor of the Town of Santa Clara,</i> 135 AD3d 1138, 1142 [3d Dept 2016], <i>lv denied</i> 27 NY3d 906 [2016] [\"property valuation — including setting the appropriate capitalization rate — is largely a question of fact\"]).</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the parties' remaining arguments and find them unavailing.  </p>\n<p>THIS CONSTITUTES THE DECISION AND ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT.</p>\n<p>ENTERED: October 7, 2025</p>\n\n\n<br><br><div>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n",

(Standard), which managed the entities and properties.</p>\n<p>Contrary to plaintiff's contentions, the trial court correctly applied a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) to the value of his membership interests in the LLCs (<i>see Matter of Giaimo v Vitale</i>, 101 AD3d 523 [1st Dept 2012]). The determination of fair value rests on \"[I]n fixing fair value, courts should determine the minority shareholder's proportionate interest in the value of the corporation as a whole, that is, what a willing purchaser, in an arm's length transaction, would offer for the corporation as an operating business (Matter<i> of Friedman v Beway Realty Corp.</i> (87 NY2d 161, 168 [1995]; <i>see also Blake v Blake Agency</i>, 107 AD2d 139, 146 [2d Dept 1985]). The next step is to calculate the DLOM (<i>see id.</i> at 170-171). It is \"not an exact science, and it is the 'particular facts and circumstances' of each case that will dictate the result\" (<i>Giaimo,</i> 101 AD3d at 524], quoting <i>Beway</i>, 87 NY2d at 167]).</p>\n<p>Based on the record before the trial court, its choice to credit defendants' business valuation expert over plaintiff's \"can 'be reached under a[] fair interpretation of the evidence'\" (<i>Matter of Levine v Seven Pines Assoc. L.P.</i>,156 AD3d 524, 525 [1st Dept 2017][internal citation omitted]). Namely, defendants' expert's conclusion relied on the protracted litigation between the parties, the lack of an operating agreement setting forth a process for withdrawal and the amount of time and money spent on \"an unwillingness to compromise,\" all of which highlights the difficulties a third-party investor would risk in purchasing the LLCs and supports the DLOM applied (<i>see generally Giaimo</i>, 101 AD3d 523). Conversely, plaintiff failed to submit any evidence supporting the value of a DLOM, maintaining instead that no discount should apply.</p>\n<p>While plaintiff's expert concluded, alternatively, that the DLOM should be 3-5%, plaintiff failed to make this argument or rely on this conclusion in his post-trial brief. As noted, plaintiff continued to maintain that the DLOM must be zero. Therefore, his current contention \"is improperly raised for the first time on appeal\" (<i>International Mdse. Group Ams. v Segerman Intl.,</i> 277 AD2d 168 [1st Dept 2000]).</p>\n<p>Next, the trial court rejected defendant's argument that loans Standard owed to the LLCs should be eliminated from the valuation calculation because of Standard's purported insolvency. Plaintiff does not contest this conclusion on appeal, but instead maintains that Standard's outstanding loans must be reduced by the 15% DLOM applied to plaintiff's share of the LLCs. This position is also \"improperly raised for the first time on appeal\" (<i>International Mdse. Group Ams.</i>, 277 AD2d 168), and is in any event rejected. The trial court correctly applied the DLOM against the aggregate net asset value of the LLCs (<i>see Beway</i>, 87 NY2d at 166). That Standard and the LLCs have the same partners and members, respectively, does not affect each entities' books and records. To that end, the LLCs' loans receivable have no bearing on the loans payable by Standard, a completely separate and distinct entity.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's contention that the court should have awarded him interest on the value of his membership interests pursuant to CPLR 5001(a) is precluded by our decision on the prior appeal in this action (<i>Rosenblum v Rosenblum</i>, 214 AD3d 440 [1st Dept 2023]) (<i>see Apollo Asset Mgt., Inc. v Cernich,</i> 226 AD3d 466 [1st Dept 2024]). Plaintiff's alternative argument that he should retain post-withdrawal distributions from the LLCs is unavailing. There is simply no connection between CPLR 5001 interest and post-withdrawal distributions from the LLCs that would warrant such a result.</p>\n<p>Defendants contend that plaintiff waived his right to CPLR 5002 interest because he did not include it in his proposed judgment. However, \"[i]nterest under CPLR 5002</p>\n<p>. . . is not dependent upon . . . a specific demand\" (<i>Matter of Doman,</i> 150 AD3d 994, 996 [2d Dept 2017] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Plaintiff \"was entitled to [CPLR 5002] interest regardless of whether [it was] specifically provided for in the judgment\" (<i>NYCTL 1998-2 Trust v Wagner</i> (61 AD3d 728 [2d Dept 2009]).</p>\n<p>The reference to a \"decision\" in CPLR 5002 \"typically refers to the date that liability, as distinguished from damages, is established\" (Hon. Mark C. Dillon, Prac Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C5002:1). Therefore, interest here should run from June 14, 2024, the date of the underlying order, not July 19, 2024, the date on which the court signed the judgment.</p>\n<p>Defendants are not entitled to their own award of interest based on the (1) money Standard borrowed and that plaintiff is obligated to repay; and (2) distributions plaintiff received after he withdrew from the LLCs. First, this argument relies on CPLR 5001(a) rather than 5002, and as explained above plaintiff is not entitled to interest under the former. As for CPLR 5002, only plaintiff is entitled to interest under that since he was awarded a sum to which an award of interest could be applied.</p>\n<p>Finally, we reject defendants' contention on their cross-appeal that the court should have used their expert's capitalization rate rather than plaintiff's. The court's choice of plaintiff's expert's rate \"can be reached under a fair interpretation of the evidence\" (<i>Levine,</i> 156 AD3d at 525 [brackets and internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see also Underbruckner Realty Corp. v Tax Commn. of the City of N.Y.,</i> 94 AD3d 527, 527 [1st Dept 2012] [\"whether the . . . buildings relied upon by petitioners were valid 'comparables' was a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court\"]; <i>Matter of George A. Donaldson &amp; Sons, Inc. v Assessor of the Town of Santa Clara,</i> 135 AD3d 1138, 1142 [3d Dept 2016], <i>lv denied</i> 27 NY3d 906 [2016] [\"property valuation — including setting the appropriate capitalization rate — is largely a question of fact\"]).</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the parties' remaining arguments and find them unavailing.  THIS CONSTITUTES THE DECISION AND ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT.</p>\n<p>ENTERED: October 7, 2025</p>\n\n\n<br><br><div>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n",

Ct. No. 21CR008177)\n\n          v.\n\n CARLOS SEPULVEDA MELGOZA,\n\n          Defendant and Appellant.\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Carlos Sepulveda Melgoza of forcible rape of a minor,\nforcible oral copulation of a minor, unlawful intercourse, and incest. The charges related\nto an incident involving defendant and his 17-year-old immediate relative. Defendant\nargues on appeal that insufficient evidence supports certain counts. He contends the trial\ncourt improperly granted a prosecution request to amend the definition of force in the\npattern jury instructions, and allowed testimony about uncharged misconduct that was not\nadmissible under Evidence Code sections 1101 or 1108. Defendant argues his trial\ncounsel provided prejudicially ineffective assistance by not objecting to admission of\ndefendant’s statements during a pretext call; to testimony by a peace officer about the\nvictim’s veracity; and to expert testimony about the psychology of child sexual assault\nvictims. He argues his trial counsel also rendered ineffective assistance by asking the\nchild psychology expert a question that led to damaging testimony.\n        We conclude that granting the prosecution request to amend the pattern jury\ninstructions was erroneous and prejudicial. The judgment must therefore be reversed and\nthe matter remanded for possible retrial on the forcible rape and forcible oral copulation\ncounts. We find all other asserted errors harmless, both individually and cumulatively,\n\fsuch that defendant’s unlawful sexual intercourse and incest convictions will remain\nundisturbed.\n                          I.   TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS\n       The operative amended information charged defendant with forcible rape of a\nminor over 14 years of age (Pen. Code, § 261, subd. (a)(2); count 1); forcible oral\ncopulation of a minor over 14 years of age (Pen. Code § 287, subd. (c)(2)(C); count 2);\nunlawful sexual intercourse (Pen. Code, § 261.5, subd. (c); count 3); and incest (Pen.\nCode, § 285; count 4). (Unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.) All\ncharges involved a single victim, whom we will refer to as Jane Doe.\n   A. TRIAL EVIDENCE\n          1. Doe’s Testimony About the Charged Offenses\n       Jane Doe was living with her grandparents in September 2019 when she was 17\nyears old. She had a bedroom to herself. Defendant was a truck driver and would stay at\nthe house frequently. He usually slept in the living room.\n       Defendant called Doe’s aunt one night in September 2019 and asked for a ride\nfrom a gas station. Doe picked him up and brought him home to spend the night at the\nhouse. At bedtime, defendant asked Doe if he could sleep in her room. She agreed, and\nhe set up a sleeping area on the floor next to her bed.\n       Doe went to bed wearing a tee shirt and underwear. Doe felt defendant crawl into\nher bed after she turned off the lights. Defendant wrapped an arm and a leg around Doe.\nThis made Doe feel “scared and anxious.” Doe did not feel like she could get away\nbecause defendant was much larger. Defendant touched Doe’s breasts over her shirt. He\nmoved the blanket and took off Doe’s shirt and underwear. He also took off his\nunderwear. Defendant spread Doe’s legs and put them on his shoulder. He performed\noral sex on Doe, then arched his back and attempted to penetrate Doe’s vagina with his\npenis. His penis rubbed in between her “vagina lips.” She could feel his penis spread the\nlabia apart. Defendant eventually stopped, cleaned Doe and himself with a shirt, and\n                                              2\n\freturned to the floor to sleep. Defendant did not say anything to her during the incident.\nDoe felt “scared, confused and frozen.” The incident lasted about three minutes.\n       Doe felt “broken, destroyed, [and] confused” afterward. She took a shower, put\non multiple layers of clothes, and got back into bed. Defendant said, “I’m sorry.” Doe\ntyped a note in her phone stating defendant “just raped me,” then locked the note. The\nnext morning defendant asked her not to tell anyone about what happened. He texted her\nwhile she was at work, claiming that “he was on pills” and that he did not know what he\nwas doing.\n          2. Doe’s Testimony about Uncharged Offenses\n       Doe testified over defense objection about two previous incidents involving\ndefendant. The first occurred when she was eight years old and they were staying at a\ncasino in Yuma, Arizona. Defendant and Doe were lying in bed on their backs next to\neach other. Doe’s mother and two other children were also on the bed, farther from\ndefendant. Defendant grabbed Doe’s left hand and placed it on his penis on top of his\nclothing. She flinched, and he moved so that her hand slid off.\n       The second incident occurred several weeks before the charged offenses.\nDefendant picked up Doe from Calexico in his semi-truck to drive her to Salinas. Doe\nwas resting in the truck’s small sleeping quarters when she noticed defendant had stopped\nthe truck. Doe felt “ambush[ed]” as defendant joined her in the sleeping quarters.\nDefendant rolled over next to her and held her close to his body. Defendant was behind\nDoe, with his right leg over her legs and his right arm on top of her. Doe found that\nbehavior odd because she did not usually cuddle with defendant. He stayed there for\nabout 20 minutes before resuming the drive.\n          3. Investigating Officer’s Testimony\n       A Salinas police officer testified about his investigation of defendant’s case. The\nofficer testified that no Sexual Assault Response Team examination was ordered because\nDoe reported the incidents involving defendant two years after they were alleged to have\n                                              3\n\foccurred. The officer obtained a statement from Doe. She also agreed to participate in a\npretext call, which he described as a call in which the “victim contacts the suspect where\nthey have no idea that law enforcement has been involved, and we try to get a statement\nto see, first of all, how they react to the allegation.” He also noted officers can “guide\nquestions towards the investigation to make the case a lot stronger if it did occur.” Doe\nmade two pretext calls to defendant, which were admitted into evidence and played for\nthe jury.\n       Defendant challenges on appeal the following statements the investigating officer\nmade when explaining why he asked Doe to make the second pretext call: “Based off of\nhow the victim was emotional, I felt that she wasn’t lying about what had occurred. [⁋]\nBased off the statement, the long, drawn-out periods and deep breathing from the suspect,\nit was obvious something had occurred, and that’s why I felt it was important to try to do\nanother phone call, if feasible.”\n            4. Prosecution Expert Testimony\n       A clinical psychologist testified over defense objection as an expert on the\n“psychology of a child sexual assault victim in general.” He made clear that he had not\nreviewed any evidence about defendant’s case and that he had no opinion on whether\nDoe was assaulted. He instead discussed “misperceptions or myths that people in the\ngeneral public have about child sexual assault in general or about child sexual abuse\nvictims.” He testified that it is common for child sexual abuse victims to delay reporting\nthe abuse. Child sex abuse victims often do not “outwardly display ... fear or [ ] anxiety”\nand attempt to look as normal as possible. They often remain in contact with their\nabuser. Some child sex abuse victims dissociate while the abuse is occurring, and “they\nmight stare off, they might look off in the corner.”\n            5. Defendant’s Testimony\n       Defendant testified in his own defense. He had been a long distance truck driver\nfor 20 years, which meant he was frequently away from home. He denied any\n                                              4\n\fwrongdoing. He testified that on the night the charged offenses were alleged to have\noccurred, he arrived at the house in the evening and had dinner with Doe and others.\nDefendant testified that Doe asked him to sleep in bed with her that night. He initially\ndeclined because he always slept on the living room couch. He eventually agreed to\nsleep in her bedroom on the floor. He “took five Advil PMs,” which usually “knocks him\nout.” He denied getting into the bed at any point, and also denied engaging in any sexual\nacts with Doe.\n       As to the uncharged offenses, defendant acknowledged that his family used to stay\nat a casino hotel in Yuma. But he denied that the family ever slept in the same bed. He\ndenied ever putting Doe’s hand on his penis. He also confirmed that he drove Doe to\nSalinas in September 2019. He testified that at a truck stop he briefly tried to sleep next\nto Doe in the sleeping area of the truck. He stated, “I put my hand over [Jane Doe], but I\njust didn’t feel good – it felt very uncomfortable.” He testified that he left the sleeping\narea after about a minute and slept in the driver’s seat instead.\n   B. MODIFIED JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n       As relevant to defendant’s appellate arguments, the trial court granted a\nprosecution request to modify the pattern instructions related to the force element of\ncounts 1 and 2 to add: “Force also includes the physical movement and positioning of the\nfemale’s body to accomplish the act.”\n       The trial court also gave a modified version of CALCRIM No. 1193. The\nmodified instruction was titled, “Testimony on Child Sexual Abuse Victims\nPsychology/Behavior,” and provided: “You have heard testimony from [a clinical\npsychologist] regarding the psychology or behavior of child sexual abuse victims in\ngeneral. [⁋] [The clinical psychologist’s] testimony about the psychology or behavior of\nchild sexual abuse victims in general is not evidence that the defendant committed any of\nthe crimes charged against him or any conduct or crimes with which he was not charged.\n[⁋] You may consider this evidence only in deciding whether or not Jane Doe’s conduct\n                                              5\n\fwas not inconsistent with the conduct of someone who has been molested, and in\nevaluating the believability of her testimony.” (Some capitalization omitted.)\n   C. VERDICT AND SENTENCING\n       The jury found defendant guilty as charged. He was sentenced to 17 years in\nprison, consisting of: the middle term of nine years for forcible rape of a minor 14 years\nof age or older (§§ 261, subd. (a)(2), 264, subd. (c)(2)) and a fully consecutive middle\nterm of eight years for forcible oral copulation of a minor 14 years of age or older (§ 287,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)). Punishment for the other two counts was stayed (§ 654).\n                                    II.    DISCUSSION\n   A. AMENDED INSTRUCTION DEFINING FORCE\n       The prosecution asked that the following language be added to the instructions\ndefining the elements of counts 1 and 2: “Force also includes the physical movement and\npositioning of the female’s body to accomplish the act.” The prosecutor argued the\nspecial instruction was “closely associated with the language in” People v. Thomas\n(2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1063 (Thomas). Defense counsel clarified that she “didn’t join in\nthat [request], but I don’t disagree.” The trial court granted the request.\n           1. The Special Instruction was Legally Incorrect\n       The federal constitution “require[s] criminal convictions to rest upon a jury\ndetermination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is\ncharged, beyond a reasonable doubt.” (United States v. Gaudin (1995) 515 U.S. 506,\n510.) Jury instructions that misdescribe or omit an element of an offense violate the\nfederal constitution. (Neder v. United States (1999) 527 U.S. 1, 10 [“In both cases—\nmisdescriptions and omissions—the erroneous instruction precludes the jury from\nmaking a finding on the actual element of the offense.”].) Although defendant did not\nobject to the special instruction at trial, “ ‘[w]hether claimed instructional error affected\nthe substantial rights of the defendant necessarily requires an examination of the merits of\nthe claim.’ ” (People v. Ngo (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 126, 149; § 1259.)\n                                               6\n\f       Our Supreme Court has observed that a correct statement of law in an appellate\nopinion unrelated to jury instructions is often not a sound basis for a special jury\ninstruction. The court “strongly caution[ed] that when evaluating special instructions,\ntrial courts carefully consider whether such derivative application is consistent with their\noriginal usage.” (People v. Colantuono (1994) 7 Cal.4th 206, 221, fn. 13 (Colantuono),\nsuperseded by statute on another point as stated in People v. Conley (2016)\n63 Cal.4th 646, 660, fn. 4.) We review claims of instructional error de novo, considering\n“whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the trial court’s instructions caused the jury\nto misapply the law in violation of the Constitution.” (People v. Mitchell (2019)\n7 Cal.5th 561, 579.)\n       Both the forcible rape and forcible oral copulation counts required the prosecution\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant accomplished the offense “by means\nof force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.”\n(§§ 261, subd. (a)(2), 287, subd. (c)(2)(C).) Neither party disputes that the pattern jury\ninstructions for those offenses correctly define an offense as being “accomplished by\nforce if a person uses enough physical force to overcome the [victim’s] will.” (See\nCALCRIM Nos. 1000, 1015; People v. Griffin (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1015, 1023–1024 [“it\nhas long been recognized that ‘in order to establish force within the meaning of\nsection 261, [former] subdivision (2), the prosecution need only show the defendant used\nphysical force of a degree sufficient to support a finding that the act of sexual intercourse\nwas against the will of the [victim].’ ”].)\n       The trial court’s modified instruction unequivocally informed the jury that “[f]orce\nalso includes the physical movement and positioning of the female’s body to accomplish\nthe act.” The modification is legally incorrect because it suggests that physical\nmovement will always satisfy the force element for the charged offenses. Although\nevidence of physical movement can be sufficient to satisfy the force element, it does not\nfollow that physical movement always satisfies the force element. As the finder of fact,\n                                              7\n\fthe jury had to determine not only whether defendant physically moved or positioned\nDoe’s body but also whether any force used by defendant was sufficient to overcome her\nwill. We find it reasonably likely that the added language caused the jury to misapply the\nlaw by believing its only task was to determine whether defendant moved or positioned\nDoe, and not whether the movement met the proper legal definition of force. The\nAttorney General counters that the instruction was legally correct because it “merely\nprovided an example of one way in which the jury could find force.” But the special\ninstruction was not so phrased. The modified instruction did not inform the jury that\nphysical movement may constitute force, but rather that physical movement does\nconstitute force.\n       Relying on Thomas and other cases examining evidentiary sufficiency, the\nAttorney General argues that “a jury may properly convict based on finding this level of\nforce.” (See Thomas, supra, 15 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1071–1072 [finding sufficient\nevidence of force where Thomas “lifted [the victim] up on the sink, positioned her to face\nthe mirror, and massaged her genitals with his hand before penetrating the vagina”].) We\nacknowledge that the level of force those authorities describe can be sufficient evidence\nto support a conviction. But the requested language was not a correct statement of the\nlaw as an instruction to the jury.\n       We caution courts and counsel against the impulse to transmute observations by a\nreviewing court concerned with substantial evidence into definitional statements of law.\nAlthough such observations may have definitional value when a reviewing court reverses\ndespite the deferential standard, the fact-driven nature of a deferential affirmance based\non substantial evidence does not lend itself to broadly applicable holdings on the\nelemental requirements of a charge.\n       We also echo the Supreme Court’s caution against the assumption “that a correct\nstatement of substantive law will provide a sound basis for charging the jury.”\n(Colantuono, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 221, fn. 13.) “The discussion in an appellate decision\n                                             8\n\fis directed to the issue presented” and the reviewing court “generally does not\ncontemplate a subsequent transmutation of its words into jury instructions and hence does\nnot choose them with that end in mind.” (Ibid.) As we have noted, the Thomas court was\nconcerned with evidentiary sufficiency rather than instructional correctness. In the\ncontext of its sufficiency review, the court observed: “The jury had to find beyond a\nreasonable doubt defendant used ‘enough physical force to overcome the other person’s\nwill.’ (CALCRIM Nos. 1015, 1045.) ‘Force’ includes circumstances where the victim\ndid not want to engage in the act and the evidence does not otherwise establish the\nvictim’s positive cooperation in act or attitude. (People v. Young (1987)\n190 Cal.App.3d 248, 258.) It also includes the force used to accomplish ‘the penetration\nand the physical movement and positioning of [the victim’s] body in accomplishing the\nact.’ (Ibid.)” (Thomas, supra, 15 Cal.App.5th at p. 1071.) The Thomas court could not\nhave anticipated or intended that a single sentence about what force “also includes”\nwould be taken out of context, modified, and grafted onto a pattern jury instruction.\n       The resulting instruction, based on incomplete language taken from Thomas, is\ninconsistent with the “original usage” of that very language in Thomas. (See Colantuono,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 221, fn. 13.) The Thomas court correctly described that to find the\ndefendant guilty of forcible sexual penetration, “[t]he jury had to find beyond a\nreasonable doubt [the] defendant used ‘enough physical force to overcome the other\nperson’s will.’ ” (Thomas, supra, 15 Cal.App.5th at p. 1071.) It then specified two types\nof circumstances that fall under the general definition of force: those “where the victim\ndid not want to engage in the act and the evidence does not otherwise establish the\nvictim’s positive cooperation in act or attitude,” and those where the victim’s body is\nmoved to accomplish the act. (Ibid.) In either circumstance, the jury would have to find\nthe force used was sufficient to overcome the victim’s will.\n       Here, the jury was instructed that counts 1 and 2 required the use of “enough\nphysical force to overcome the [victim’s] will” and “[f]orce also includes the physical\n                                             9\n\fmovement and positioning of the [victim’s] body to accomplish the act.” Without\nincluding the intervening sentence from Thomas about what force “includes,” the special\ninstruction stating what force “also includes” was not merely ambiguous, it was\nmisleading. Its use of the word “also” implicitly juxtaposes “the physical movement and\npositioning of the [victim’s] body” with the use of “enough physical force to overcome\nthe [victim’s] will.” That juxtaposition incorrectly suggests that if the jury finds force\nbased on “movement and positioning” of the victim’s body, the jury need not also find\nthat the force was sufficient to overcome the victim’s will.\n       The Attorney General describes defendant as arguing “that there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury would have understood the instruction to mean that they did not\nhave to make a finding on whether [defendant] used force, in violation of his federal\nconstitutional rights.” But we understand defendant to argue only that the instruction\nincorrectly modified the definition of force, not that the instruction removed the force\nelement entirely. While we agree with the Attorney General that the “jury would have\nunderstood that it needed to find [defendant] used force in order to convict,” the critical\nproblem is that the modified instruction defined the conduct which could satisfy that\nelement too broadly. The jury’s implicit finding that defendant used force cannot cure\nthe error because it was based on an incorrect definition of that term.\n          2. The Error was Prejudicial as to Counts 1 and 2\n       The parties disagree about the applicable standard to assess the effect of the\ninstructional error. “When the jury is ‘misinstructed on an element of the\noffense ... reversal ... is required unless we are able to conclude that the error was\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.’ ” (People v. Wilkins (2013) 56 Cal.4th 333, 348;\nChapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24.) We agree with defendant that the\nChapman standard applies because the special instruction caused the jury to be\nmisinstructed on the force element of counts 1 and 2. In the related context of an omitted\nelement the Supreme Court has observed, “our task in analyzing the prejudice from the\n                                              10\n\finstructional error is whether any rational fact finder could have come to the opposite\nconclusion.” (People v. Mil (2012) 53 Cal.4th 400, 418.)\n       The error was prejudicial as to counts 1 and 2. The Attorney General argues that\nthere was “no basis for the jury to conclude that the acts occurred, but were not forcible,\nas [defendant] contends.” But there was no physical evidence supporting Doe’s\nallegations because the charged offenses occurred two years before she reported them.\nAnd Doe did not testify that defendant threatened her or struck her during the incident.\nThe evidence supporting the force element was that defendant removed Doe’s clothing\nand positioned her body to facilitate sex acts. We emphasize that the evidence would be\nsufficient to support a guilty verdict by a properly instructed jury. But a properly\ninstructed jury could also conclude that defendant did not use enough physical force to\novercome Doe’s will.\n       The prosecutor amplified the prejudicial effect of the modified instruction by\nelaborating on it during closing argument: “Force is the use of enough physical force to\novercome the female’s will. It goes on. Force also includes the physical movement or\npositioning of the female’s body to accomplish the act. I want you to understand, these\nare very specific definitions. When we think of force, we think of someone beating\nsomeone up or grabbing them and pulling them. It includes a bunch of things in the legal\nworld. It’s important to remember that.”\n       The Attorney General contends the error is harmless because “there was ample\nevidence supporting the prosecution’s alternate theory, that appellant used duress to\naccomplish the acts.” The jury was correctly instructed that “[d]uress means a direct or\nimplied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution that would cause a reasonable\nperson to do or submit to something that she would not do or submit to otherwise.” But\nthe Attorney General points to no direct or implied threat by defendant that occurred\nbefore the charged conduct. Doe’s familial relationship and youth do not, standing alone,\nsupport a finding of duress. Although Doe testified that defendant told her not to tell\n                                             11\n\fanyone, that did not occur until the morning after the incident. On this record, we cannot\nconclude that the error did not affect the verdict on counts 1 and 2.\n   B. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n       Defendant argues insufficient evidence supports the convictions on counts 1, 3,\nand 4. He contends the conduct Doe described—defendant rubbing his penis between her\n“vagina lips”—does not amount to sexual intercourse as that term has been interpreted in\nCalifornia Supreme Court decisions. “In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we\nreview the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether\nit discloses evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable\ntrier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” (People v. Bolin\n(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 331.) We do not reweigh evidence or second-guess credibility\ndeterminations. (People v. Ramirez (2022) 13 Cal.5th 997, 1118.) We presume the\nexistence of every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence to\nsupport the judgment. (Ibid.) To overturn a conviction based on insufficient evidence,\n“it must clearly appear that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial\nevidence to support it.” (People v. Redmond (1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755.)\n       To prove counts 1, 3, and 4, the prosecution had to prove defendant had “sexual\nintercourse” with Jane Doe. That phrase is not defined in the three Penal Code sections\nthat form the basis for the challenged counts. (§§ 261, 261.5, 285.)\n       Section 263 states, “Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to\ncomplete the crime” of rape. The phrase “sexual penetration” has long been interpreted\nin the context of rape to mean that “[p]enetration of the external genital organs is\nsufficient to constitute sexual penetration and to complete the crime of rape even if the\nrapist does not thereafter succeed in penetrating into the vagina.” (People v. Karsai\n(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 224, 232, disapproved on another ground by People v. Jones\n(1988) 46 Cal.3d 585, 600, fn. 8; accord, People v. Dunn (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1086,\n\n\n                                             12\n\f1097 [relying on Karsai to find that sexual intercourse requires proof of “penetration of\n[the victim’s] labia majora, not her vagina”].)\n       Consistent with those authorities, the jury was instructed that “Sexual intercourse\nmeans any penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or genitalia by the penis.”\nDoe testified that defendant rubbed his penis in between her “vagina lips” and she could\nfeel his penis spread them apart. That testimony provides sufficient evidence to support\nhis conviction.\n       Defendant notes that the California Supreme Court has sometimes referred to the\npenetration necessary to support rape as “vaginal penetration.” (People v. Holt (1997)\n15 Cal.4th 619, 676; see also People v. Stitely (2005) 35 Cal.4th 514, 554–555.) But\nthose opinions did so in the context of differentiating between rape and sodomy. For\nexample, the defendant in Holt argued the jury instructions “did not inform the jury that\nthe penetration required was penetration of the vagina and the jury might have believed\nthat anal penetration was sufficient.” (Holt, at pp. 675–676.) In rejecting that argument,\nthe Supreme Court concluded “there is no possibility that the jury did not understand that\nin the court’s instruction on rape, the intercourse to which the instruction referred\nrequired penetration of the victim’s vaginal genitalia.” (Id. at p. 677; accord, Stitely, at\npp. 554–555 [“defendant could not have been convicted of nonconsensual sexual\nintercourse and rape based on anal penetration used to prove sodomy.”].) The Holt court\ndid not purport to narrow the definition of “sexual intercourse” to include only vaginal\npenetration. (People v. Ault (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1268, fn. 10 [“It is axiomatic that\ncases are not authority for propositions not considered.”].) Nor could it, as the\nLegislature has stated in section 263 that any sexual penetration is sufficient to complete\nthe crime of rape.\n   C. UNCHARGED ACTS EVIDENCE (EVID. CODE, §§ 1108, 1101)\n       The prosecution moved in limine to admit evidence of two uncharged acts\ninvolving defendant and Doe under Evidence Code sections 1108 and 1101, subdivision\n                                              13\n\f(b). Defense counsel objected, arguing the uncharged acts were too dissimilar to the\ncharged acts and were unduly prejudicial. The trial court granted the prosecution’s\nmotion and allowed Doe to testify about the two uncharged acts. We review the trial\ncourt’s decisions on admissibility for abuse of discretion.\n          1. Admissibility Under Evidence Code Section 1108\n       Evidence Code section 1108 provides an exception to the general rule that\n“evidence of a person’s character or a trait of his or her character ... is inadmissible when\noffered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion.” (Evid. Code, § 1101,\nsubd. (a).) Evidence that a defendant committed a sexual offense is admissible character\nevidence when the defendant is accused of a sexual offense, so long as the evidence is not\nmade inadmissible by Evidence Code section 352. (Evid. Code, § 1108, subd. (a); Evid.\nCode, § 352 [trial court has discretion to “exclude evidence if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue\nconsumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the\nissues, or of misleading the jury.”].)\n       A trial court “must engage in a careful weighing process” when determining\nwhether to admit evidence under Evidence Code section 1108. (People v. Falsetta\n(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 916–917 (Falsetta).) “Rather than admit or exclude every sex\noffense a defendant commits, trial judges must consider such factors as its nature,\nrelevance, and possible remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the\nlikelihood of confusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its\nsimilarity to the charged offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on\nthe defendant in defending against the uncharged offense, and the availability of less\nprejudicial alternatives to its outright admission, such as admitting some but not all of the\ndefendant’s other sex offenses, or excluding irrelevant though inflammatory details\nsurrounding the offense.” (Falsetta, at p. 917.)\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Multiple factors support the trial court’s decision to admit testimony about the\ncasino hotel incident during which defendant allegedly grabbed Doe’s hand and placed it\non his penis over his clothes. The incident bore some similarity to the charged offenses\nin that it involved the same victim and consisted of defendant moving Doe to facilitate\nactivity of a sexual nature. The uncharged act did not involve conduct substantially more\nprejudicial than the charged counts. The risk of distracting the jury and the burden of\ndefending against the uncharged offense were low because that portion of Doe’s\ntestimony was limited to a small number of questions. Although we acknowledge that\nthe uncharged offense was somewhat remote in that it occurred about nine years before\nthe charged offenses, that factor alone does not make the evidence inadmissible.\n       Defendant argues the uncharged act was too speculative to be used to prove\ndefendant was predisposed to commit sex acts against Doe. His argument is based on\nDoe’s testimony that she did not disclose the casino hotel incident earlier because she\nthought defendant may have mistakenly grabbed her hand. But we review the trial\ncourt’s decision based on the information it had when it made the decision, not based on\ntestimony adduced after the fact. (See People v. Williams (2006) 40 Cal.4th 287, 311\n[“we review whether the trial court’s decision was correct at the time it was made and not\nin light of subsequent events.”].) We see no abuse of discretion in allowing the\ntestimony.\n       Defendant contends the trial court should not have allowed testimony about the\ntruck sleeping area incident “because it did not constitute a sexual offense.” But\ndefendant did not object on that basis in the trial court. Counsel’s objection was that they\nwere dissimilar, unduly prejudicial, “currently uncharged,” and “very minor.” Defendant\nhas forfeited the argument by not objecting on that basis in the trial court. (Perez v.\nGrajales (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 580, 591–592 [“arguments raised for the first time on\nappeal are generally deemed forfeited.”].)\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Even assuming the issue is cognizable on appeal, we see no error. The\n“admissibility of uncharged conduct pursuant to [Evidence Code] section 1108 turns on\nthe existence of a preliminary fact—namely, that the uncharged conduct constitutes a\nstatutorily enumerated ‘sexual offense.’ ” (People v. Jandres (2014)\n226 Cal.App.4th 340, 353.) “The trial court must make a preliminary determination of\nwhether the proffered evidence is sufficient for the jury to find, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that the defendant committed an enumerated offense.” (Ibid.) We review the\ntrial court’s determination of the preliminary fact for abuse of discretion. (Ibid.)\n       “To convict a defendant of violating section 647.6, the prosecution must prove:\n(1) the defendant engaged in conduct directed at a child; (2) a normal person, without\nhesitation, would have been disturbed, irritated, offended, or injured by the defendant’s\nconduct; (3) the defendant’s conduct was motivated by an unnatural or abnormal sexual\ninterest in the child; and (4) the child was under the age of 18 years at the time of the\nconduct. It is not necessary that the child actually be irritated or disturbed or that the\nchild actually be touched.” (People v. Clotfelter (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 30, 50\n(Clotfelter).)\n       We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s determination that the proffered\nevidence was sufficient for the jury to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\ndefendant violated section 647.6. Defendant directed his conduct at Doe, who was a\nminor. A rational trier of fact could conclude that a person would be disturbed or\nirritated by someone wrapping his leg and arm over them while holding them close for 20\nminutes. A rational trier of fact could also conclude defendant’s conduct was motivated\nby an unnatural or abnormal interest in the child.\n       Many authorities defendant cites involved challenges to the sufficiency of the\nevidence to support a section 647.6 conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, not challenges\nto the admissibility of Evidence Code section 1108 evidence that must be proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence. We also find the conduct at issue in those cases less\n                                              16\n\ftroubling than that at issue here. (E.g., People v. Valenti (2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1140,\n1162 [reversing section 647.6 conviction that was based on Valenti hugging a frequent\nhouseguest three times and kissing another on the top of the head once, over the course of\nseveral years], superseded by statute, as stated in People v. Villegas (2023)\n97 Cal.App.5th 253, 281, fn. 9; Clotfelter, supra, 65 Cal.App.5th at p. 53 [reversing\nsection 647.6 conviction of someone considered a part of the victim’s family, reasoning\n“it was not objectively disturbing within the meaning of section 647.6 for them to be\ntogether or exchange e-mails or gifts.”].)\n          2. Admissibility Under Evidence Code Section 1101, Subdivision (b)\n       Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) makes admissible “evidence that a\nperson committed a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to prove some fact\n(such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of\nmistake or accident, or whether a defendant in a prosecution for an unlawful sexual act or\nattempted unlawful sexual act did not reasonably and in good faith believe that the victim\nconsented) other than his or her disposition to commit such an act.” “Evidence of\nuncharged crimes is admissible to prove identity, common design or plan, or intent only\nif the charged and uncharged crimes are sufficiently similar to support a rational\ninference of identity, common design or plan, or intent.” (People v. Carter (2005)\n36 Cal.4th 1114, 1147–1148.) When introduced so show similar intent, the uncharged\ncrimes need only be sufficiently similar to the charged offenses to support an inference\nthat the defendant likely harbored the same intent in each. (People v. Kipp (1998) 18\nCal.4th 349, 371.)\n       We agree with defendant that the uncharged acts were inadmissible under\nEvidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b). Defendant categorically denied engaging\nin the charged acts. He did not offer an innocent reason for any actions, which could then\nbe disproven by evidence of uncharged acts to show intent, motive, or absence of\n\n\n                                             17\n\fmistake. (See People v. Ewoldt (1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 394, fn. 2 [“ ‘In proving intent, the\nact is conceded or assumed; what is sought is the state of mind that accompanied it.’ ”].)\n       While we agree there was no permissible Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision\n(b) purpose for the uncharged acts evidence, we find that its admission did not render\ndefendant’s trial fundamentally unfair. We further find the state law error harmless as to\ncounts 3 and 4 after considering whether it is reasonably probable that defendant would\nhave obtained a more favorable result had the objection been sustained. (People v.\nWatson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) As we have explained, the same uncharged acts\nevidence was admissible under Evidence Code section 1108, such that it was properly\nbefore the jury for another purpose. The jury was also instructed that the evidence was\n“not sufficient by itself to prove that the defendant is guilty of the charged offenses.”\nAnd Doe’s testimony provided credible evidence from which the jury could convict\ndefendant on counts 3 and 4.\n   D. EFFECTIVENESS OF TRIAL COUNSEL\n       Defendant contends his trial counsel rendered prejudicially deficient assistance by\nnot objecting to certain trial evidence. To establish ineffectiveness of trial counsel in\nviolation of a defendant’s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, a defendant must show both that counsel’s performance was deficient\nand that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. (People v. Ledesma (1987) 43 Cal.3d 171,\n216–217 (Ledesma).) Deficient performance is rarely shown if there was a tactical\nreason for trial counsel’s conduct. (See People v. Cruz (1980) 26 Cal.3d 233, 255–256\n[“except in rare cases, an appellate court should not attempt to second-guess trial counsel\nas to tactics”].) The “decision whether to object, move to strike, or seek\nadmonition ... is highly tactical, and depends upon counsel’s evaluation of the gravity of\nthe problem and whether objection or other responses would serve only to highlight [it].”\n(People v. Catlin (2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 165 (Catlin).) An attorney does not provide\ndeficient assistance if she fails to make a meritless objection. (People v. Ochoa (1998)\n                                             18\n\f19 Cal.4th 353, 463 (Ochoa).) To prove prejudice, a defendant must affirmatively show\na reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel’s errors, the result would have been\ndifferent. (Ledesma, at pp. 217–218.)\n          1. Pretext Call Evidence\n\n       Defendant argues his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not objecting\nto the admission of statements defendant made in two pretext calls. He contends his\nstatements were irrelevant and unconstitutionally involuntary.\n       Doe made two pretext phone calls to defendant in October 2021. Videos of the\ncalls were admitted into evidence and played for the jury. Two officers were in the room\nwith Doe when she placed the calls. One of the officers confirmed during his testimony\nthat he wrote Doe notes to encourage her to ask defendant about particular details.\n       In the first call, Doe asked defendant if he remembered “when you did that to me”\nat her grandmother’s house two years earlier. Defendant responded, “I know something\nthat happened. I vaguely remember. The truth is I was — I was on meth[.]” Doe stated,\n“You had sex with me. Do you remember?” Defendant responded, “Ah, what? I don’t.\nAre you serious?” Doe later stated, “You had sex with me,” and defendant responded,\n“Nooo.” Defendant stated in response to another question, “Ah, son of a fucking bitch.\nWhat the fuck did I do?”\n       In the second call, defendant stated that he did not remember hugging Doe. He\nremembered that “[y]ou were on the bed. I was on the floor. I remember that.” Doe\nasked, “Do you remember pulling down like, my underwear?” Defendant responded,\n“Stop. I don’t wanna hear that shit. What the fuck?” He asked how he could help her\nand she responded, “By saying the truth, because I just wanna know why?” Defendant\nstated, “I don’t know why. I don’t know how much, I was on — I was blasted with I\ndon’t know what. I don’t know what the fuck happened, I don’t know what took over\nme. I don’t know. And now I - I mean, now that you’re telling me, it’s like what the\nfuck? Now it has to fucking I - I was wonde- I - I don’t know. I don’t know what the\n                                             19\n\ffuck I’m gonna do. What — what - what can - what can I do? What can I do, what -\nwhat.” Doe continued asking defendant what he remembered, and he responded that he\ndid not remember anything. Defendant eventually stated, “I’m so sorry (crying). I’m\nsorry.” Defense counsel did not move in limine to exclude the pretext call evidence;\ncounsel did object at trial to admission of the pretext call videos based on lack of\nfoundation, which the trial court overruled.\n       Involuntary statements obtained by law enforcement are inadmissible under the\ndue process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. (People v. Dykes (2009)\n46 Cal.4th 731, 752.) Whether a statement is involuntary depends on the totality of the\ncircumstances. (People v. Williams (2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 436.) “The question is\nwhether the statement is the product of an ‘ “essentially free and unconstrained choice” ’\nor whether the defendant’s ‘ “will has been overborne and his capacity for self-\ndetermination critically impaired” ’ by coercion.” (Ibid.) Relevant considerations\ninclude the extent of any police coercion; the length of the interrogation; its location; its\ncontinuity; as well as the defendant’s maturity, education, physical condition, and mental\nhealth. (Ibid.)\n       Reviewing the totality of the circumstances, defendant’s statements during the\npretext call were not involuntary. We acknowledge that Doe received notes during the\ncall prompting her to ask defendant about certain details of her allegations. But the\ncrucial factor for our analysis is that defendant had no idea law enforcement was\ninvolved. The record does not show that his will was overborne merely by Doe asking\nquestions in phone calls while defendant was not in custody. That defendant had no\nknowledge of law enforcement’s involvement distinguishes this case from Arizona v.\nFulminante (1991) 499 U.S. 279, 283, 287, where a government informant inmate was\nused to extract a confession from a suspect who was in custody. And because\ndefendant’s statements were voluntary, counsel was not deficient for not raising a\nmeritless objection. (Ochoa, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 463.)\n                                               20\n\f       Defendant argues that in “order to give Doe an answer to her question [about why\nhe did it], [defendant] had to accept the allegations as true.” But nothing required\ndefendant to accept Doe’s comments as true or to admit any misconduct. Defendant was\nfree to deny all wrongdoing, which he did in large part.\n       Defendant alternatively contends that “reasonably competent counsel would have\nmoved to sanitize the evidence.” Defendant argues his statement near the beginning of\nthe first pretext call that “I know something that happened” was speculative, irrelevant,\nand unduly prejudicial because it “was made before Doe made the allegation.”\nDefendant made the statement after Doe referred to something that happened two years\nearlier in her room at her grandmother’s house. In that context, defendant’s statement\nwas relevant to what occurred on that occasion, and defendant’s statement was not\nunduly prejudicial, as he admitted only that “something” happened. Counsel was not\ndeficient under these circumstances.\n       Defendant also argues that trial counsel should have moved to exclude his\nreference to methamphetamine use during the pretext calls as irrelevant and unduly\nprejudicial. But defendant put his mental state at issue by testifying that he took “five\nAdvil PMs” the night of the charged offenses, and his substance use the same night was\nrelevant to the jury’s consideration of his mental state.\n          2. Testimony About Doe’s Veracity\n       Defendant contends his trial counsel was prejudicially deficient for not objecting\nto testimony by an investigating officer that defendant argues amounted to inadmissible\nopinion testimony regarding Doe’s veracity and defendant’s guilt.\n       To explain why he asked Doe to make the second pretext call, the investigating\nofficer testified, “Based off of how the victim was emotional, I felt that she wasn’t lying\nabout what had occurred. [⁋] Based off the statement, the long, drawn-out periods and\ndeep breathing from the suspect, it was obvious something had occurred, and that’s why I\n\n\n                                             21\n\ffelt it was important to try to do another phone call, if feasible.” Defense counsel did not\nobject.\n          Counsel had a tactical reason to not object so as not to call attention to the\nstatement (Catlin, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 165), which was brief and somewhat ambiguous\n(referring only to “what had occurred”). The prosecutor did not linger on the subject,\ninstead immediately asking, “And was another phone call done?” The fleeting nature of\nthe officer’s statement distinguishes this case from People v. Sergill (1982)\n138 Cal.App.3d 34, which found prejudicial error in allowing two officers to opine that\nthey believed the complaining witness was truthful in statements to law enforcement.\n(Id. at pp. 38-40.) We also find People v. Julian (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 878, 889 (Julian)\ndistinguishable, because there it was defense counsel rather than the prosecutor who\nasked the officer whether he believed the victim was being honest. And we do not find\nthe isolated statement so severe as to violate defendant’s federal constitutional rights to\ndue process, an impartial jury, or a reliable verdict.\n   E. EXPERT EVIDENCE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CHILD SEX ASSAULT VICTIMS\n          The trial court denied defendant’s in limine motion to exclude expert testimony by\na clinical psychologist about the “psychology of a child sexual assault victim in general.”\n(We note that neither the prosecutor nor the witness used the term “Child Sexual Abuse\nAccommodation Syndrome” in front of the jury, though the witness described consistent\nconcepts, such as delayed reporting.) We review a trial court’s decision to admit expert\ntestimony for abuse of discretion. (People v. McAlpin (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1299–1300\n(McAlpin).)\n             1. The Expert’s Testimony was Admissible\n          The Evidence Code provides that expert testimony is admissible if it is “[r]elated\nto a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert\nwould assist the trier of fact” and is “[b]ased on matter (including his special knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, and education) perceived by or personally known to the\n                                                22\n\fwitness or made known to him at or before the hearing.” (Evid. Code, § 801, subds. (a),\n(b).) Defendant argues that testimony about the psychology of child sex assault victims\ngenerally should be inadmissible because it is unreliable and unduly prejudicial. In\nMcAlpin, the Supreme Court reviewed a challenge to expert testimony about “whether a\nparent might not report a known child molestation, and if so, why.” (McAlpin, supra,\n53 Cal.3d at p. 1298.) Finding no abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court analogized the\nchallenged testimony “to expert testimony on common stress reactions of children who\nhave been sexually molested (‘child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome’), which\nalso may include the child’s failure to report, or delay in reporting, the abuse.” (Id. at\np. 1300.) The McAlpin court noted that several decisions from the courts of appeal had\nfound that while “expert testimony on the common reactions of child molestation victims\nis not admissible to prove that the complaining witness has in fact been sexually abused;\nit is admissible to rehabilitate such witness’s credibility when the defendant suggests that\nthe child’s conduct after the incident—e.g., a delay in reporting—is inconsistent with his\nor her testimony claiming molestation.” (Ibid.)\n\n       Relying on decisions from courts in other states, defendant asks us to find expert\ntestimony of the type provided in this case inadmissible for all purposes as a matter of\nlaw. (E.g., Blount v. Commonwealth (Ky. 2013) 392 S.W.3d 393, 396; State v. Ballard\n(Tenn. 1993) 855 S.W.2d 557, 562.) But to the extent the California Supreme Court\nexpressly approved the admissibility of such evidence in McAlpin, we are bound by that\nprecedent. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455.)\nDefendant acknowledges that California appellate courts have consistently found expert\ntestimony like that provided here admissible under McAlpin. (See People v. Ramirez\n(2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 175, 219–220 (Ramirez); People v. Munch (2020)\n52 Cal.App.5th 464, 468 (Munch); People v. Lapenias (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 162, 172\n(Lapenias).) Defendant’s out of state authorities offer no compelling reason to depart\nfrom California precedent.\n                                             23\n\f          2. No Due Process Violation\n      Defendant argues admitting the expert testimony violated his constitutional due\nprocess rights “because it allowed the jury to make the unreasonable inferences that,\nbecause Doe behaved in the way molestation victims do, as described by [the clinical\npsychologist], she was molested, and her testimony was credible.” But the expert made\nclear that he had not reviewed any evidence about defendant’s case and had formed no\nopinion on whether Doe was assaulted. The jury was properly instructed that “testimony\nabout the psychology or behavior of child sexual abuse victims in general is not evidence\nthat the defendant committed any of the crimes charged against him or any conduct or\ncrimes with which he was not charged.” (See CALCRIM No. 1193.) Multiple courts\nhave held that CALCRIM No. 1193 accurately informs the jury on the limited use of\nchild psychology evidence and does not: “(a) improperly allow an alleged minor victim\nof sexual abuse to corroborate her own testimony; (b) violate due process; or (c) misapply\nthe burden of proof.” (Lapenias, supra, 67 Cal.App.5th at p. 175, citing People v.\nGonzales (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 494, 503–504; accord, Munch, supra, 52 Cal.App.5th at\npp. 473–474; Ramirez, supra, 98 Cal.App.5th at pp. 219–220.) Nothing in the record\nhere suggests the jury nonetheless misunderstood or misapplied the instruction as given.\n          3. Counsel’s Performance was Not Prejudicially Deficient\n      Defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting damaging\ntestimony from the prosecution’s expert during cross-examination in the following\nexchange. Defense counsel: “And do you have any experience with children that were\nnot sexually abused but said they were?” Psychologist: “False allegations of sexual\nabuse? Certainly.” Defense counsel: “So that does occur?” Psychologist: “False\nallegations of sexual abuse are uncommon, rare, but they do occur.”\n      Defendant argues trial counsel performed deficiently because “expert opinion\ntestimony stating that false accusations are ‘rare’ and ‘uncommon’ can only be harmful to\nappellant’s defense.” But the expert’s testimony also informed the jury that false\n                                            24\n\fallegations of sexual abuse “[c]ertainly” occur, even if they are uncommon or rare. Trial\ncounsel therefore had a tactical reason for asking questions that introduced the jury to the\nconcept of false allegations.\n       Even if we were to assume that counsel’s performance was deficient, defendant\nhas not demonstrated prejudice as to counts 3 and 4. The expert’s testimony about the\nrarity of false allegations was brief. The lawyers did not focus on that testimony during\nclosing argument. The expert made clear he had no opinion about the specific facts of\nthe case. The jury was instructed about the limited admissibility of the expert’s\ntestimony. (See CALCRIM No. 1193.) And Doe’s testimony provided credible evidence\nfrom which the jury could convict defendant of counts 3 and 4. (See Lapenias, supra,\n67 Cal.App.5th at p. 180 [“we find it is not reasonably probable Lapenias would have\nreceived a more favorable result in the absence of [the expert’s] erroneously admitted\ntestimony about the rarity of false allegations of child sexual abuse”].) The limited\nnature of the testimony distinguishes this case from those finding reversible error.\n(Julian, supra, 34 Cal.App.5th at p. 886 [testimony that “92 to 99 percent” of child sex\nabuse claims are true]; People v. Wilson (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 559, 570 [“testimony had\nthe effect of telling the jury there was at least a 94 percent chance that any given child\nwho claimed to have been sexually abused was telling the truth”].)\n   F. NO CUMULATIVE PREJUDICE\n       “Lengthy criminal trials are rarely perfect,” and a judgment will not be reversed\n“absent a clear showing of a miscarriage of justice.” (People v. Hill (1998)\n17 Cal.4th 800, 844.) “Nevertheless, a series of trial errors, though independently\nharmless, may in some circumstances rise by accretion to the level of reversible and\nprejudicial error.” (Ibid.) We have discussed two arguable evidentiary errors: the\ninadmissibility of uncharged acts under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), and\ndefense counsel’s eliciting expert testimony that false child sex abuse allegations are rare.\n\n\n                                             25\n\fEven considered together, we find those errors were not cumulatively prejudicial as to\ncounts 3 and 4.\n                                 III.   DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for possible retrial on counts\n1 and 2 and resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\f                               ____________________________________\n                               Grover, J.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n____________________________\nGreenwood, P.

Ct. No. 21CR008177)\n\n          v.\n\n CARLOS SEPULVEDA MELGOZA,\n\n          Defendant and Appellant.\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Carlos Sepulveda Melgoza of forcible rape of a minor,\nforcible oral copulation of a minor, unlawful intercourse, and incest. The charges related\nto an incident involving defendant and his 17-year-old immediate relative. Defendant\nargues on appeal that insufficient evidence supports certain counts. He contends the trial\ncourt improperly granted a prosecution request to amend the definition of force in the\npattern jury instructions, and allowed testimony about uncharged misconduct that was not\nadmissible under Evidence Code sections 1101 or 1108. Defendant argues his trial\ncounsel provided prejudicially ineffective assistance by not objecting to admission of\ndefendant’s statements during a pretext call; to testimony by a peace officer about the\nvictim’s veracity; and to expert testimony about the psychology of child sexual assault\nvictims. He argues his trial counsel also rendered ineffective assistance by asking the\nchild psychology expert a question that led to damaging testimony.\n        We conclude that granting the prosecution request to amend the pattern jury\ninstructions was erroneous and prejudicial. The judgment must therefore be reversed and\nthe matter remanded for possible retrial on the forcible rape and forcible oral copulation\ncounts. We find all other asserted errors harmless, both individually and cumulatively,\n\fsuch that defendant’s unlawful sexual intercourse and incest convictions will remain\nundisturbed.\n                          I.   TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS\n       The operative amended information charged defendant with forcible rape of a\nminor over 14 years of age (Pen. Code, § 261, subd. (a)(2); count 1); forcible oral\ncopulation of a minor over 14 years of age (Pen. Code § 287, subd. (c)(2)(C); count 2);\nunlawful sexual intercourse (Pen. Code, § 261.5, subd. (c); count 3); and incest (Pen.\nCode, § 285; count 4). (Unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.) All\ncharges involved a single victim, whom we will refer to as Jane Doe.\n   A. TRIAL EVIDENCE\n          1. Doe’s Testimony About the Charged Offenses\n       Jane Doe was living with her grandparents in September 2019 when she was 17\nyears old. She had a bedroom to herself. Defendant was a truck driver and would stay at\nthe house frequently. He usually slept in the living room.\n       Defendant called Doe’s aunt one night in September 2019 and asked for a ride\nfrom a gas station. Doe picked him up and brought him home to spend the night at the\nhouse. At bedtime, defendant asked Doe if he could sleep in her room. She agreed, and\nhe set up a sleeping area on the floor next to her bed.\n       Doe went to bed wearing a tee shirt and underwear. Doe felt defendant crawl into\nher bed after she turned off the lights. Defendant wrapped an arm and a leg around Doe.\nThis made Doe feel “scared and anxious.” Doe did not feel like she could get away\nbecause defendant was much larger. Defendant touched Doe’s breasts over her shirt. He\nmoved the blanket and took off Doe’s shirt and underwear. He also took off his\nunderwear. Defendant spread Doe’s legs and put them on his shoulder. He performed\noral sex on Doe, then arched his back and attempted to penetrate Doe’s vagina with his\npenis. His penis rubbed in between her “vagina lips.” She could feel his penis spread the\nlabia apart. Defendant eventually stopped, cleaned Doe and himself with a shirt, and\n                                              2\n\freturned to the floor to sleep. Defendant did not say anything to her during the incident.\nDoe felt “scared, confused and frozen.” The incident lasted about three minutes.\n       Doe felt “broken, destroyed, [and] confused” afterward. She took a shower, put\non multiple layers of clothes, and got back into bed. Defendant said, “I’m sorry.” Doe\ntyped a note in her phone stating defendant “just raped me,” then locked the note. The\nnext morning defendant asked her not to tell anyone about what happened. He texted her\nwhile she was at work, claiming that “he was on pills” and that he did not know what he\nwas doing.\n          2. Doe’s Testimony about Uncharged Offenses\n       Doe testified over defense objection about two previous incidents involving\ndefendant. The first occurred when she was eight years old and they were staying at a\ncasino in Yuma, Arizona. Defendant and Doe were lying in bed on their backs next to\neach other. Doe’s mother and two other children were also on the bed, farther from\ndefendant. Defendant grabbed Doe’s left hand and placed it on his penis on top of his\nclothing. She flinched, and he moved so that her hand slid off.\n       The second incident occurred several weeks before the charged offenses.\nDefendant picked up Doe from Calexico in his semi-truck to drive her to Salinas. Doe\nwas resting in the truck’s small sleeping quarters when she noticed defendant had stopped\nthe truck. Doe felt “ambush[ed]” as defendant joined her in the sleeping quarters.\nDefendant rolled over next to her and held her close to his body. Defendant was behind\nDoe, with his right leg over her legs and his right arm on top of her. Doe found that\nbehavior odd because she did not usually cuddle with defendant. He stayed there for\nabout 20 minutes before resuming the drive.\n          3. Investigating Officer’s Testimony\n       A Salinas police officer testified about his investigation of defendant’s case. The\nofficer testified that no Sexual Assault Response Team examination was ordered because\nDoe reported the incidents involving defendant two years after they were alleged to have\n                                              3\n\foccurred. The officer obtained a statement from Doe. She also agreed to participate in a\npretext call, which he described as a call in which the “victim contacts the suspect where\nthey have no idea that law enforcement has been involved, and we try to get a statement\nto see, first of all, how they react to the allegation.” He also noted officers can “guide\nquestions towards the investigation to make the case a lot stronger if it did occur.” Doe\nmade two pretext calls to defendant, which were admitted into evidence and played for\nthe jury.\n       Defendant challenges on appeal the following statements the investigating officer\nmade when explaining why he asked Doe to make the second pretext call: “Based off of\nhow the victim was emotional, I felt that she wasn’t lying about what had occurred. [⁋]\nBased off the statement, the long, drawn-out periods and deep breathing from the suspect,\nit was obvious something had occurred, and that’s why I felt it was important to try to do\nanother phone call, if feasible.”\n            4. Prosecution Expert Testimony\n       A clinical psychologist testified over defense objection as an expert on the\n“psychology of a child sexual assault victim in general.” He made clear that he had not\nreviewed any evidence about defendant’s case and that he had no opinion on whether\nDoe was assaulted. He instead discussed “misperceptions or myths that people in the\ngeneral public have about child sexual assault in general or about child sexual abuse\nvictims.” He testified that it is common for child sexual abuse victims to delay reporting\nthe abuse. Child sex abuse victims often do not “outwardly display ... fear or [ ] anxiety”\nand attempt to look as normal as possible. They often remain in contact with their\nabuser. Some child sex abuse victims dissociate while the abuse is occurring, and “they\nmight stare off, they might look off in the corner.”\n            5. Defendant’s Testimony\n       Defendant testified in his own defense. He had been a long distance truck driver\nfor 20 years, which meant he was frequently away from home. He denied any\n                                              4\n\fwrongdoing. He testified that on the night the charged offenses were alleged to have\noccurred, he arrived at the house in the evening and had dinner with Doe and others.\nDefendant testified that Doe asked him to sleep in bed with her that night. He initially\ndeclined because he always slept on the living room couch. He eventually agreed to\nsleep in her bedroom on the floor. He “took five Advil PMs,” which usually “knocks him\nout.” He denied getting into the bed at any point, and also denied engaging in any sexual\nacts with Doe.\n       As to the uncharged offenses, defendant acknowledged that his family used to stay\nat a casino hotel in Yuma. But he denied that the family ever slept in the same bed. He\ndenied ever putting Doe’s hand on his penis. He also confirmed that he drove Doe to\nSalinas in September 2019. He testified that at a truck stop he briefly tried to sleep next\nto Doe in the sleeping area of the truck. He stated, “I put my hand over [Jane Doe], but I\njust didn’t feel good – it felt very uncomfortable.” He testified that he left the sleeping\narea after about a minute and slept in the driver’s seat instead.\n   B. MODIFIED JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n       As relevant to defendant’s appellate arguments, the trial court granted a\nprosecution request to modify the pattern instructions related to the force element of\ncounts 1 and 2 to add: “Force also includes the physical movement and positioning of the\nfemale’s body to accomplish the act.”\n       The trial court also gave a modified version of CALCRIM No. 1193. The\nmodified instruction was titled, “Testimony on Child Sexual Abuse Victims\nPsychology/Behavior,” and provided: “You have heard testimony from [a clinical\npsychologist] regarding the psychology or behavior of child sexual abuse victims in\ngeneral. [⁋] [The clinical psychologist’s] testimony about the psychology or behavior of\nchild sexual abuse victims in general is not evidence that the defendant committed any of\nthe crimes charged against him or any conduct or crimes with which he was not charged.\n[⁋] You may consider this evidence only in deciding whether or not Jane Doe’s conduct\n                                              5\n\fwas not inconsistent with the conduct of someone who has been molested, and in\nevaluating the believability of her testimony.” (Some capitalization omitted.)\n   C. VERDICT AND SENTENCING\n       The jury found defendant guilty as charged. He was sentenced to 17 years in\nprison, consisting of: the middle term of nine years for forcible rape of a minor 14 years\nof age or older (§§ 261, subd. (a)(2), 264, subd. (c)(2)) and a fully consecutive middle\nterm of eight years for forcible oral copulation of a minor 14 years of age or older (§ 287,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)). Punishment for the other two counts was stayed (§ 654).\n                                    II.    DISCUSSION\n   A. AMENDED INSTRUCTION DEFINING FORCE\n       The prosecution asked that the following language be added to the instructions\ndefining the elements of counts 1 and 2: “Force also includes the physical movement and\npositioning of the female’s body to accomplish the act.” The prosecutor argued the\nspecial instruction was “closely associated with the language in” People v. Thomas\n(2017) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6105966\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239064/people-v-thomas/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

Defense counsel clarified that she “didn’t join in\nthat [request], but I don’t disagree.” The trial court granted the request.\n           1. The Special Instruction was Legally Incorrect\n       The federal constitution “require[s] criminal convictions to rest upon a jury\ndetermination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is\ncharged, beyond a reasonable doubt.” (United States v. Gaudin (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9433188\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/#510\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Gaudin\">515 U.S. 506,\n510</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Jury instructions that misdescribe or omit an element of an offense violate the\nfederal constitution. (Neder v.

We review claims of instructional error de novo, considering\n“whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the trial court’s instructions caused the jury\nto misapply the law in violation of the Constitution.” (People v. Mitchell (2019)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4409582\"><a href=\"/opinion/4632329/people-v-mitchell/#579\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

(a)(2), 287, subd. (c)(2)(C).) Neither party disputes that the pattern jury\ninstructions for those offenses correctly define an offense as being “accomplished by\nforce if a person uses enough physical force to overcome the [victim’s] will.” (See\nCALCRIM Nos. 1000, 1015; People v. Griffin (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2547493\"><a href=\"/opinion/2547493/people-v-griffin/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Griffin\">33 Cal.4th 1015</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023–1024 [“it\nhas long been recognized that ‘in order to establish force within the meaning of\nsection 261, [former] subdivision (2), the prosecution need only show the defendant used\nphysical force of a degree sufficient to support a finding that the act of sexual intercourse\nwas against the will of the [victim].’ ”].)\n       The trial court’s modified instruction unequivocally informed the jury that “[f]orce\nalso includes the physical movement and positioning of the female’s body to accomplish\nthe act.” The modification is legally incorrect because it suggests that physical\nmovement will always satisfy the force element for the charged offenses. Although\nevidence of physical movement can be sufficient to satisfy the force element, it does not\nfollow that physical movement always satisfies the force element. As the finder of fact,\n                                              7\n\fthe jury had to determine not only whether defendant physically moved or positioned\nDoe’s body but also whether any force used by defendant was sufficient to overcome her\nwill. We find it reasonably likely that the added language caused the jury to misapply the\nlaw by believing its only task was to determine whether defendant moved or positioned\nDoe, and not whether the movement met the proper legal definition of force. The\nAttorney General counters that the instruction was legally correct because it “merely\nprovided an example of one way in which the jury could find force.” But the special\ninstruction was not so phrased. The modified instruction did not inform the jury that\nphysical movement may constitute force, but rather that physical movement does\nconstitute force.\n       Relying on Thomas and other cases examining evidentiary sufficiency, the\nAttorney General argues that “a jury may properly convict based on finding this level of\nforce.” (See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6105966\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239064/people-v-thomas/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Thomas\">Thomas, supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 15 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1071–1072 [finding sufficient\nevidence of force where Thomas “lifted [the victim] up on the sink, positioned her to face\nthe mirror, and massaged her genitals with his hand before penetrating the vagina”].) We\nacknowledge that the level of force those authorities describe can be sufficient evidence\nto support a conviction. But the requested language was not a correct statement of the\nlaw as an instruction to the jury.\n       We caution courts and counsel against the impulse to transmute observations by a\nreviewing court concerned with substantial evidence into definitional statements of law.\nAlthough such observations may have definitional value when a reviewing court reverses\ndespite the deferential standard, the fact-driven nature of a deferential affirmance based\non substantial evidence does not lend itself to broadly applicable holdings on the\nelemental requirements of a charge.\n       We also echo the Supreme Court’s caution against the assumption “that a correct\nstatement of substantive law will provide a sound basis for charging the jury.”\n(Colantuono, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9574770\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235091/people-v-colantuono/#221\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

As we have noted, the Thomas court was\nconcerned with evidentiary sufficiency rather than instructional correctness. In the\ncontext of its sufficiency review, the court observed: “The jury had to find beyond a\nreasonable doubt defendant used ‘enough physical force to overcome the other person’s\nwill.’ (CALCRIM Nos. 1015, 1045.) ‘Force’ includes circumstances where the victim\ndid not want to engage in the act and the evidence does not otherwise establish the\nvictim’s positive cooperation in act or attitude. (People v. Young (1987)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132596\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132596/people-v-young/#258\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

It also includes the force used to accomplish ‘the penetration\nand the physical movement and positioning of [the victim’s] body in accomplishing the\nact.’ (Ibid.)” (Thomas, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6105966\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239064/people-v-thomas/#1071\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Thomas\">15 Cal.App.5th at p. 1071</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) The Thomas court could not\nhave anticipated or intended that a single sentence about what force “also includes”\nwould be taken out of context, modified, and grafted onto a pattern jury instruction.\n       The resulting instruction, based on incomplete language taken from Thomas, is\ninconsistent with the “original usage” of that very language in Thomas. (See Colantuono,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9574770\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235091/people-v-colantuono/#221\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Colantuono\">7 Cal.4th at p. 221, fn. 13</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) The Thomas court correctly described that to find the\ndefendant guilty of forcible sexual penetration, “[t]he jury had to find beyond a\nreasonable doubt [the] defendant used ‘enough physical force to overcome the other\nperson’s will.’ ” (Thomas, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6105966\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239064/people-v-thomas/#1071\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Thomas\">15 Cal.App.5th at p. 1071</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) It then specified two types\nof circumstances that fall under the general definition of force: those “where the victim\ndid not want to engage in the act and the evidence does not otherwise establish the\nvictim’s positive cooperation in act or attitude,” and those where the victim’s body is\nmoved to accomplish the act. (Ibid.) In either circumstance, the jury would have to find\nthe force used was sufficient to overcome the victim’s will.\n       Here, the jury was instructed that counts 1 and 2 required the use of “enough\nphysical force to overcome the [victim’s] will” and “[f]orce also includes the physical\n                                             9\n\fmovement and positioning of the [victim’s] body to accomplish the act.” Without\nincluding the intervening sentence from Thomas about what force “includes,” the special\ninstruction stating what force “also includes” was not merely ambiguous, it was\nmisleading. Its use of the word “also” implicitly juxtaposes “the physical movement and\npositioning of the [victim’s] body” with the use of “enough physical force to overcome\nthe [victim’s] will.” That juxtaposition incorrectly suggests that if the jury finds force\nbased on “movement and positioning” of the victim’s body, the jury need not also find\nthat the force was sufficient to overcome the victim’s will.\n       The Attorney General describes defendant as arguing “that there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury would have understood the instruction to mean that they did not\nhave to make a finding on whether [defendant] used force, in violation of his federal\nconstitutional rights.” But we understand defendant to argue only that the instruction\nincorrectly modified the definition of force, not that the instruction removed the force\nelement entirely. While we agree with the Attorney General that the “jury would have\nunderstood that it needed to find [defendant] used force in order to convict,” the critical\nproblem is that the modified instruction defined the conduct which could satisfy that\nelement too broadly. The jury’s implicit finding that defendant used force cannot cure\nthe error because it was based on an incorrect definition of that term.\n          2. The Error was Prejudicial as to Counts 1 and 2\n       The parties disagree about the applicable standard to assess the effect of the\ninstructional error. “When the jury is ‘misinstructed on an element of the\noffense ... reversal ... is required unless we are able to conclude that the error was\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.’ ” (People v. Wilkins (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"854599\"><a href=\"/opinion/854599/people-v-wilkins/#348\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

California\">386 U.S. 18, 24</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) We agree with defendant that the\nChapman standard applies because the special instruction caused the jury to be\nmisinstructed on the force element of counts 1 and 2. In the related context of an omitted\nelement the Supreme Court has observed, “our task in analyzing the prejudice from the\n                                              10\n\finstructional error is whether any rational fact finder could have come to the opposite\nconclusion.” (People v.

Mil\">53 Cal.4th 400, 418</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n       The error was prejudicial as to counts 1 and 2. The Attorney General argues that\nthere was “no basis for the jury to conclude that the acts occurred, but were not forcible,\nas [defendant] contends.” But there was no physical evidence supporting Doe’s\nallegations because the charged offenses occurred two years before she reported them.\nAnd Doe did not testify that defendant threatened her or struck her during the incident.\nThe evidence supporting the force element was that defendant removed Doe’s clothing\nand positioned her body to facilitate sex acts. We emphasize that the evidence would be\nsufficient to support a guilty verdict by a properly instructed jury. But a properly\ninstructed jury could also conclude that defendant did not use enough physical force to\novercome Doe’s will.\n       The prosecutor amplified the prejudicial effect of the modified instruction by\nelaborating on it during closing argument: “Force is the use of enough physical force to\novercome the female’s will. It goes on. Force also includes the physical movement or\npositioning of the female’s body to accomplish the act. I want you to understand, these\nare very specific definitions. When we think of force, we think of someone beating\nsomeone up or grabbing them and pulling them. It includes a bunch of things in the legal\nworld. It’s important to remember that.”\n       The Attorney General contends the error is harmless because “there was ample\nevidence supporting the prosecution’s alternate theory, that appellant used duress to\naccomplish the acts.” The jury was correctly instructed that “[d]uress means a direct or\nimplied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution that would cause a reasonable\nperson to do or submit to something that she would not do or submit to otherwise.” But\nthe Attorney General points to no direct or implied threat by defendant that occurred\nbefore the charged conduct. Doe’s familial relationship and youth do not, standing alone,\nsupport a finding of duress. Although Doe testified that defendant told her not to tell\n                                             11\n\fanyone, that did not occur until the morning after the incident. On this record, we cannot\nconclude that the error did not affect the verdict on counts 1 and 2.\n   B. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n       Defendant argues insufficient evidence supports the convictions on counts 1, 3,\nand 4. He contends the conduct Doe described—defendant rubbing his penis between her\n“vagina lips”—does not amount to sexual intercourse as that term has been interpreted in\nCalifornia Supreme Court decisions. “In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we\nreview the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether\nit discloses evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable\ntrier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” (People v. Bolin\n(1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433861\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433861/people-v-bolin/#331\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

Ramirez (2022) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">13 Cal.5th 997</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118.) We presume the\nexistence of every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence to\nsupport the judgment. (Ibid.) To overturn a conviction based on insufficient evidence,\n“it must clearly appear that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial\nevidence to support it.” (People v. Redmond (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9546425\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169922/people-v-redmond/#755\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Redmond\">71 Cal.2d 745, 755</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n       To prove counts 1, 3, and 4, the prosecution had to prove defendant had “sexual\nintercourse” with Jane Doe. That phrase is not defined in the three Penal Code sections\nthat form the basis for the challenged counts. (§§ 261, 261.5, 285.)\n       Section 263 states, “Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to\ncomplete the crime” of rape. The phrase “sexual penetration” has long been interpreted\nin the context of rape to mean that “[p]enetration of the external genital organs is\nsufficient to constitute sexual penetration and to complete the crime of rape even if the\nrapist does not thereafter succeed in penetrating into the vagina.” (People v.

That testimony provides sufficient evidence to support\nhis conviction.\n       Defendant notes that the California Supreme Court has sometimes referred to the\npenetration necessary to support rape as “vaginal penetration.” (People v.

For\nexample, the defendant in Holt argued the jury instructions “did not inform the jury that\nthe penetration required was penetration of the vagina and the jury might have believed\nthat anal penetration was sufficient.” (Holt, at pp. 675–676.) In rejecting that argument,\nthe Supreme Court concluded “there is no possibility that the jury did not understand that\nin the court’s instruction on rape, the intercourse to which the instruction referred\nrequired penetration of the victim’s vaginal genitalia.” (Id. at p. 677; accord, Stitely, at\npp. 554–555 [“defendant could not have been convicted of nonconsensual sexual\nintercourse and rape based on anal penetration used to prove sodomy.”].) The Holt court\ndid not purport to narrow the definition of “sexual intercourse” to include only vaginal\npenetration. (People v.

Nor could it, as the\nLegislature has stated in section 263 that any sexual penetration is sufficient to complete\nthe crime of rape.\n   C. UNCHARGED ACTS EVIDENCE (EVID. CODE, §§ 1108, 1101)\n       The prosecution moved in limine to admit evidence of two uncharged acts\ninvolving defendant and Doe under Evidence Code sections 1108 and 1101, subdivision\n                                              13\n\f(b). Defense counsel objected, arguing the uncharged acts were too dissimilar to the\ncharged acts and were unduly prejudicial. The trial court granted the prosecution’s\nmotion and allowed Doe to testify about the two uncharged acts. We review the trial\ncourt’s decisions on admissibility for abuse of discretion.\n          1. Admissibility Under Evidence Code Section 1108\n       Evidence Code section 1108 provides an exception to the general rule that\n“evidence of a person’s character or a trait of his or her character ... is inadmissible when\noffered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion.” (Evid. Code, § 1101,\nsubd. (a).) Evidence that a defendant committed a sexual offense is admissible character\nevidence when the defendant is accused of a sexual offense, so long as the evidence is not\nmade inadmissible by Evidence Code section 352. (Evid. Code, § 1108, subd. (a); Evid.\nCode, § 352 [trial court has discretion to “exclude evidence if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue\nconsumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the\nissues, or of misleading the jury.”].)\n       A trial court “must engage in a careful weighing process” when determining\nwhether to admit evidence under Evidence Code section 1108. (People v. Falsetta\n(1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9559960\"><a href=\"/opinion/1200056/people-v-falsetta/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Falsetta\">21 Cal.4th 903</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 916–917 (Falsetta).) “Rather than admit or exclude every sex\noffense a defendant commits, trial judges must consider such factors as its nature,\nrelevance, and possible remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the\nlikelihood of confusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its\nsimilarity to the charged offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on\nthe defendant in defending against the uncharged offense, and the availability of less\nprejudicial alternatives to its outright admission, such as admitting some but not all of the\ndefendant’s other sex offenses, or excluding irrelevant though inflammatory details\nsurrounding the offense.” (Falsetta, at p. 917.)\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Multiple factors support the trial court’s decision to admit testimony about the\ncasino hotel incident during which defendant allegedly grabbed Doe’s hand and placed it\non his penis over his clothes. The incident bore some similarity to the charged offenses\nin that it involved the same victim and consisted of defendant moving Doe to facilitate\nactivity of a sexual nature. The uncharged act did not involve conduct substantially more\nprejudicial than the charged counts. The risk of distracting the jury and the burden of\ndefending against the uncharged offense were low because that portion of Doe’s\ntestimony was limited to a small number of questions. Although we acknowledge that\nthe uncharged offense was somewhat remote in that it occurred about nine years before\nthe charged offenses, that factor alone does not make the evidence inadmissible.\n       Defendant argues the uncharged act was too speculative to be used to prove\ndefendant was predisposed to commit sex acts against Doe. His argument is based on\nDoe’s testimony that she did not disclose the casino hotel incident earlier because she\nthought defendant may have mistakenly grabbed her hand. But we review the trial\ncourt’s decision based on the information it had when it made the decision, not based on\ntestimony adduced after the fact. (See People v. Williams (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9784009\"><a href=\"/opinion/2543191/people-v-williams/#311\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Williams\">40 Cal.4th 287, 311</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n[“we review whether the trial court’s decision was correct at the time it was made and not\nin light of subsequent events.”].) We see no abuse of discretion in allowing the\ntestimony.\n       Defendant contends the trial court should not have allowed testimony about the\ntruck sleeping area incident “because it did not constitute a sexual offense.” But\ndefendant did not object on that basis in the trial court. Counsel’s objection was that they\nwere dissimilar, unduly prejudicial, “currently uncharged,” and “very minor.” Defendant\nhas forfeited the argument by not objecting on that basis in the trial court. (Perez v.\nGrajales (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248277\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248277/perez-v-grajales/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Perez v.

The\n“admissibility of uncharged conduct pursuant to [Evidence Code] section 1108 turns on\nthe existence of a preliminary fact—namely, that the uncharged conduct constitutes a\nstatutorily enumerated ‘sexual offense.’ ” (People v. Jandres (2014)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2675084\"><a href=\"/opinion/2675084/people-v-jandres/#353\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Jandres\">226 Cal.App.4th 340, 353</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) “The trial court must make a preliminary determination of\nwhether the proffered evidence is sufficient for the jury to find, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that the defendant committed an enumerated offense.” (Ibid.) We review the\ntrial court’s determination of the preliminary fact for abuse of discretion. (Ibid.)\n       “To convict a defendant of violating section 647.6, the prosecution must prove:\n(1) the defendant engaged in conduct directed at a child; (2) a normal person, without\nhesitation, would have been disturbed, irritated, offended, or injured by the defendant’s\nconduct; (3) the defendant’s conduct was motivated by an unnatural or abnormal sexual\ninterest in the child; and (4) the child was under the age of 18 years at the time of the\nconduct. It is not necessary that the child actually be irritated or disturbed or that the\nchild actually be touched.” (People v. Clotfelter (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.App.5th 30</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50\n(Clotfelter).)\n       We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s determination that the proffered\nevidence was sufficient for the jury to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\ndefendant violated section 647.6. Defendant directed his conduct at Doe, who was a\nminor. A rational trier of fact could conclude that a person would be disturbed or\nirritated by someone wrapping his leg and arm over them while holding them close for 20\nminutes. A rational trier of fact could also conclude defendant’s conduct was motivated\nby an unnatural or abnormal interest in the child.\n       Many authorities defendant cites involved challenges to the sufficiency of the\nevidence to support a section 647.6 conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, not challenges\nto the admissibility of Evidence Code section 1108 evidence that must be proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence. We also find the conduct at issue in those cases less\n                                              16\n\ftroubling than that at issue here. (E.g., People v.

Admissibility Under Evidence Code Section 1101, Subdivision (b)\n       Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) makes admissible “evidence that a\nperson committed a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to prove some fact\n(such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of\nmistake or accident, or whether a defendant in a prosecution for an unlawful sexual act or\nattempted unlawful sexual act did not reasonably and in good faith believe that the victim\nconsented) other than his or her disposition to commit such an act.” “Evidence of\nuncharged crimes is admissible to prove identity, common design or plan, or intent only\nif the charged and uncharged crimes are sufficiently similar to support a rational\ninference of identity, common design or plan, or intent.” (People v. Carter (2005)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629957\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629957/people-v-carter/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Carter\">36 Cal.4th 1114</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1147–1148.) When introduced so show similar intent, the uncharged\ncrimes need only be sufficiently similar to the charged offenses to support an inference\nthat the defendant likely harbored the same intent in each. (People v. Kipp (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433926\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433926/people-v-kipp/#371\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Kipp\">18\nCal.4th 349, 371</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n       We agree with defendant that the uncharged acts were inadmissible under\nEvidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b). Defendant categorically denied engaging\nin the charged acts. He did not offer an innocent reason for any actions, which could then\nbe disproven by evidence of uncharged acts to show intent, motive, or absence of\n\n\n                                             17\n\fmistake.

We further find the state law error harmless as to\ncounts 3 and 4 after considering whether it is reasonably probable that defendant would\nhave obtained a more favorable result had the objection been sustained. (People v.\nWatson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9631606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/#836\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Watson\">46 Cal.2d 818, 836</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) As we have explained, the same uncharged acts\nevidence was admissible under Evidence Code section 1108, such that it was properly\nbefore the jury for another purpose. The jury was also instructed that the evidence was\n“not sufficient by itself to prove that the defendant is guilty of the charged offenses.”\nAnd Doe’s testimony provided credible evidence from which the jury could convict\ndefendant on counts 3 and 4.\n   D. EFFECTIVENESS OF TRIAL COUNSEL\n       Defendant contends his trial counsel rendered prejudicially deficient assistance by\nnot objecting to certain trial evidence. To establish ineffectiveness of trial counsel in\nviolation of a defendant’s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, a defendant must show both that counsel’s performance was deficient\nand that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. (People v. Ledesma (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9570635\"><a href=\"/opinion/1228080/people-v-ledesma/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Ledesma\">43 Cal.3d 171</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n216–217 (Ledesma).) Deficient performance is rarely shown if there was a tactical\nreason for trial counsel’s conduct. (See People v.

The “decision whether to object, move to strike, or seek\nadmonition ... is highly tactical, and depends upon counsel’s evaluation of the gravity of\nthe problem and whether objection or other responses would serve only to highlight [it].”\n(People v. Catlin (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621193/people-v-catlin/#165\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

To prove prejudice, a defendant must affirmatively show\na reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel’s errors, the result would have been\ndifferent. (Ledesma, at pp. 217–218.)\n          1. Pretext Call Evidence\n\n       Defendant argues his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not objecting\nto the admission of statements defendant made in two pretext calls. He contends his\nstatements were irrelevant and unconstitutionally involuntary.\n       Doe made two pretext phone calls to defendant in October 2021. Videos of the\ncalls were admitted into evidence and played for the jury. Two officers were in the room\nwith Doe when she placed the calls. One of the officers confirmed during his testimony\nthat he wrote Doe notes to encourage her to ask defendant about particular details.\n       In the first call, Doe asked defendant if he remembered “when you did that to me”\nat her grandmother’s house two years earlier. Defendant responded, “I know something\nthat happened. I vaguely remember. The truth is I was — I was on meth[.]” Doe stated,\n“You had sex with me. Do you remember?” Defendant responded, “Ah, what? I don’t.\nAre you serious?” Doe later stated, “You had sex with me,” and defendant responded,\n“Nooo.” Defendant stated in response to another question, “Ah, son of a fucking bitch.\nWhat the fuck did I do?”\n       In the second call, defendant stated that he did not remember hugging Doe. He\nremembered that “[y]ou were on the bed. I was on the floor. I remember that.” Doe\nasked, “Do you remember pulling down like, my underwear?” Defendant responded,\n“Stop. I don’t wanna hear that shit. What the fuck?” He asked how he could help her\nand she responded, “By saying the truth, because I just wanna know why?” Defendant\nstated, “I don’t know why. I don’t know how much, I was on — I was blasted with I\ndon’t know what. I don’t know what the fuck happened, I don’t know what took over\nme. I don’t know. And now I - I mean, now that you’re telling me, it’s like what the\nfuck? Now it has to fucking I - I was wonde- I - I don’t know. I don’t know what the\n                                             19\n\ffuck I’m gonna do. What — what - what can - what can I do? What can I do, what -\nwhat.” Doe continued asking defendant what he remembered, and he responded that he\ndid not remember anything. Defendant eventually stated, “I’m so sorry (crying). I’m\nsorry.” Defense counsel did not move in limine to exclude the pretext call evidence;\ncounsel did object at trial to admission of the pretext call videos based on lack of\nfoundation, which the trial court overruled.\n       Involuntary statements obtained by law enforcement are inadmissible under the\ndue process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. (People v. Dykes (2009)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/#752\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

Relevant considerations\ninclude the extent of any police coercion; the length of the interrogation; its location; its\ncontinuity; as well as the defendant’s maturity, education, physical condition, and mental\nhealth. (Ibid.)\n       Reviewing the totality of the circumstances, defendant’s statements during the\npretext call were not involuntary. We acknowledge that Doe received notes during the\ncall prompting her to ask defendant about certain details of her allegations. But the\ncrucial factor for our analysis is that defendant had no idea law enforcement was\ninvolved. The record does not show that his will was overborne merely by Doe asking\nquestions in phone calls while defendant was not in custody. That defendant had no\nknowledge of law enforcement’s involvement distinguishes this case from Arizona v.\nFulminante (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9432240\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/#283\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Arizona v.

Ochoa\">19 Cal.4th at p. 463</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n                                               20\n\f       Defendant argues that in “order to give Doe an answer to her question [about why\nhe did it], [defendant] had to accept the allegations as true.” But nothing required\ndefendant to accept Doe’s comments as true or to admit any misconduct. Defendant was\nfree to deny all wrongdoing, which he did in large part.\n       Defendant alternatively contends that “reasonably competent counsel would have\nmoved to sanitize the evidence.” Defendant argues his statement near the beginning of\nthe first pretext call that “I know something that happened” was speculative, irrelevant,\nand unduly prejudicial because it “was made before Doe made the allegation.”\nDefendant made the statement after Doe referred to something that happened two years\nearlier in her room at her grandmother’s house. In that context, defendant’s statement\nwas relevant to what occurred on that occasion, and defendant’s statement was not\nunduly prejudicial, as he admitted only that “something” happened. Counsel was not\ndeficient under these circumstances.\n       Defendant also argues that trial counsel should have moved to exclude his\nreference to methamphetamine use during the pretext calls as irrelevant and unduly\nprejudicial. But defendant put his mental state at issue by testifying that he took “five\nAdvil PMs” the night of the charged offenses, and his substance use the same night was\nrelevant to the jury’s consideration of his mental state.\n          2. Testimony About Doe’s Veracity\n       Defendant contends his trial counsel was prejudicially deficient for not objecting\nto testimony by an investigating officer that defendant argues amounted to inadmissible\nopinion testimony regarding Doe’s veracity and defendant’s guilt.\n       To explain why he asked Doe to make the second pretext call, the investigating\nofficer testified, “Based off of how the victim was emotional, I felt that she wasn’t lying\nabout what had occurred. [⁋] Based off the statement, the long, drawn-out periods and\ndeep breathing from the suspect, it was obvious something had occurred, and that’s why I\n\n\n                                             21\n\ffelt it was important to try to do another phone call, if feasible.” Defense counsel did not\nobject.\n          Counsel had a tactical reason to not object so as not to call attention to the\nstatement (Catlin, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621193/people-v-catlin/#165\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Catlin\">26 Cal.4th at p. 165</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), which was brief and somewhat ambiguous\n(referring only to “what had occurred”). The prosecutor did not linger on the subject,\ninstead immediately asking, “And was another phone call done?” The fleeting nature of\nthe officer’s statement distinguishes this case from People v. Sergill (1982)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120546/people-v-sergill/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Sergill\">138 Cal.App.3d 34</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which found prejudicial error in allowing two officers to opine that\nthey believed the complaining witness was truthful in statements to law enforcement.\n(Id. at pp. 38-40.) We also find People v. Julian (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107393\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240446/people-v-julian/#889\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Julian\">34 Cal.App.5th 878, 889</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Julian)\ndistinguishable, because there it was defense counsel rather than the prosecutor who\nasked the officer whether he believed the victim was being honest. And we do not find\nthe isolated statement so severe as to violate defendant’s federal constitutional rights to\ndue process, an impartial jury, or a reliable verdict.\n   E. EXPERT EVIDENCE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CHILD SEX ASSAULT VICTIMS\n          The trial court denied defendant’s in limine motion to exclude expert testimony by\na clinical psychologist about the “psychology of a child sexual assault victim in general.”\n(We note that neither the prosecutor nor the witness used the term “Child Sexual Abuse\nAccommodation Syndrome” in front of the jury, though the witness described consistent\nconcepts, such as delayed reporting.) We review a trial court’s decision to admit expert\ntestimony for abuse of discretion. (People v. McAlpin (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9614076\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386826/people-v-mcalpin/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. McAlpin\">53 Cal.3d 1289</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1299–1300\n(McAlpin).)\n             1. The Expert’s Testimony was Admissible\n          The Evidence Code provides that expert testimony is admissible if it is “[r]elated\nto a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert\nwould assist the trier of fact” and is “[b]ased on matter (including his special knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, and education) perceived by or personally known to the\n                                                22\n\fwitness or made known to him at or before the hearing.” (Evid. Code, § 801, subds. (a),\n(b).) Defendant argues that testimony about the psychology of child sex assault victims\ngenerally should be inadmissible because it is unreliable and unduly prejudicial. In\nMcAlpin, the Supreme Court reviewed a challenge to expert testimony about “whether a\nparent might not report a known child molestation, and if so, why.” (McAlpin, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9614076\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386826/people-v-mcalpin/#1298\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. McAlpin\">53 Cal.3d at p. 1298</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Finding no abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court analogized the\nchallenged testimony “to expert testimony on common stress reactions of children who\nhave been sexually molested (‘child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome’), which\nalso may include the child’s failure to report, or delay in reporting, the abuse.” (Id. at\np. 1300.) The McAlpin court noted that several decisions from the courts of appeal had\nfound that while “expert testimony on the common reactions of child molestation victims\nis not admissible to prove that the complaining witness has in fact been sexually abused;\nit is admissible to rehabilitate such witness’s credibility when the defendant suggests that\nthe child’s conduct after the incident—e.g., a delay in reporting—is inconsistent with his\nor her testimony claiming molestation.” (Ibid.)\n\n       Relying on decisions from courts in other states, defendant asks us to find expert\ntestimony of the type provided in this case inadmissible for all purposes as a matter of\nlaw. (E.g., Blount v. Commonwealth (Ky. 2013) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5112647\"><a href=\"/opinion/5284371/blount-v-commonwealth/#396\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Blount v. Commonwealth\">392 S.W.3d 393, 396</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; State v. Ballard\n(Tenn. 1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9666910\"><a href=\"/opinion/1669236/state-v-ballard/#562\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v. Ballard\">855 S.W.2d 557, 562</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) But to the extent the California Supreme Court\nexpressly approved the admissibility of such evidence in McAlpin, we are bound by that\nprecedent. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5451350\"><a href=\"/opinion/5607245/auto-equity-sales-inc-v-superior-court/#455\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court\">57 Cal.2d 450, 455</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\nDefendant acknowledges that California appellate courts have consistently found expert\ntestimony like that provided here admissible under McAlpin. (See People v. Ramirez\n(2023) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">98 Cal.App.5th 175</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219–220 (Ramirez); People v. Munch (2020)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 Cal.App.5th 464</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468 (Munch); People v. Lapenias (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">67 Cal.App.5th 162</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172\n(Lapenias).) Defendant’s out of state authorities offer no compelling reason to depart\nfrom California precedent.\n                                             23\n\f          2. No Due Process Violation\n      Defendant argues admitting the expert testimony violated his constitutional due\nprocess rights “because it allowed the jury to make the unreasonable inferences that,\nbecause Doe behaved in the way molestation victims do, as described by [the clinical\npsychologist], she was molested, and her testimony was credible.” But the expert made\nclear that he had not reviewed any evidence about defendant’s case and had formed no\nopinion on whether Doe was assaulted. The jury was properly instructed that “testimony\nabout the psychology or behavior of child sexual abuse victims in general is not evidence\nthat the defendant committed any of the crimes charged against him or any conduct or\ncrimes with which he was not charged.” (See CALCRIM No. 1193.) Multiple courts\nhave held that CALCRIM No. 1193 accurately informs the jury on the limited use of\nchild psychology evidence and does not: “(a) improperly allow an alleged minor victim\nof sexual abuse to corroborate her own testimony; (b) violate due process; or (c) misapply\nthe burden of proof.” (Lapenias, supra, 67 Cal.App.5th at p. 175, citing People v.\nGonzales (2017) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6106029\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239126/people-v-gonzales/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Gonzales\">16 Cal.App.5th 494</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503–504; accord, Munch, supra, 52 Cal.App.5th at\npp. 473–474; Ramirez, supra, 98 Cal.App.5th at pp. 219–220.) Nothing in the record\nhere suggests the jury nonetheless misunderstood or misapplied the instruction as given.\n          3. Counsel’s Performance was Not Prejudicially Deficient\n      Defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting damaging\ntestimony from the prosecution’s expert during cross-examination in the following\nexchange. Defense counsel: “And do you have any experience with children that were\nnot sexually abused but said they were?” Psychologist: “False allegations of sexual\nabuse? Certainly.” Defense counsel: “So that does occur?” Psychologist: “False\nallegations of sexual abuse are uncommon, rare, but they do occur.”\n      Defendant argues trial counsel performed deficiently because “expert opinion\ntestimony stating that false accusations are ‘rare’ and ‘uncommon’ can only be harmful to\nappellant’s defense.” But the expert’s testimony also informed the jury that false\n                                            24\n\fallegations of sexual abuse “[c]ertainly” occur, even if they are uncommon or rare. Trial\ncounsel therefore had a tactical reason for asking questions that introduced the jury to the\nconcept of false allegations.\n       Even if we were to assume that counsel’s performance was deficient, defendant\nhas not demonstrated prejudice as to counts 3 and 4. The expert’s testimony about the\nrarity of false allegations was brief. The lawyers did not focus on that testimony during\nclosing argument. The expert made clear he had no opinion about the specific facts of\nthe case. The jury was instructed about the limited admissibility of the expert’s\ntestimony. (See CALCRIM No. 1193.) And Doe’s testimony provided credible evidence\nfrom which the jury could convict defendant of counts 3 and 4. (See Lapenias, supra,\n67 Cal.App.5th at p. 180 [“we find it is not reasonably probable Lapenias would have\nreceived a more favorable result in the absence of [the expert’s] erroneously admitted\ntestimony about the rarity of false allegations of child sexual abuse”].) The limited\nnature of the testimony distinguishes this case from those finding reversible error.\n(Julian, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107393\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240446/people-v-julian/#886\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Julian\">34 Cal.App.5th at p. 886</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [testimony that “92 to 99 percent” of child sex\nabuse claims are true]; People v. Wilson (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107302\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240360/people-v-wilson/#570\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Wilson\">33 Cal.App.5th 559, 570</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [“testimony had\nthe effect of telling the jury there was at least a 94 percent chance that any given child\nwho claimed to have been sexually abused was telling the truth”].)\n   F. NO CUMULATIVE PREJUDICE\n       “Lengthy criminal trials are rarely perfect,” and a judgment will not be reversed\n“absent a clear showing of a miscarriage of justice.” (People v. Hill (1998)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5650421\"><a href=\"/opinion/5795442/people-v-hill/#844\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Hill\">17 Cal.4th 800, 844</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) “Nevertheless, a series of trial errors, though independently\nharmless, may in some circumstances rise by accretion to the level of reversible and\nprejudicial error.” (Ibid.) We have discussed two arguable evidentiary errors: the\ninadmissibility of uncharged acts under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), and\ndefense counsel’s eliciting expert testimony that false child sex abuse allegations are rare.\n\n\n                                             25\n\fEven considered together, we find those errors were not cumulatively prejudicial as to\ncounts 3 and 4.\n                                 III.   DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for possible retrial on counts\n1 and 2 and resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\f                               ____________________________________\n                               Grover, J.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n____________________________\nGreenwood, P.

Petition granted.\n                Bober, Peterson & Koby and Timothy A. Peterson for Petitioner\nAtlanta Falcons.\n                Seyfarth Shaw, Robert E.

Fairchild and Shiloh Rasmusson for\nRespondent Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.\n                Pro Athlete Law Group, Kaleena VanGalio and Roy E. LaFrancis,\nJr., for Respondent Wayne Gandy.\n\f            Wayne Gandy spent 15 years—from 1994 to 2009—as a\nprofessional football player with the National Football League (NFL). He\nplayed with the Los Angeles Rams (LA Rams) during the 1994 season, his\nfirst with the NFL. He played the next three years with the St. Louis Rams\n(STL Rams) under the contract he had signed in California with the LA\nRams, but he never again played for a California team. He played for the\nPittsburgh Steelers (Steelers) from April 1999 to February 2003, the New\nOrleans Saints (Saints) from March 2003 to April 2006, and finally,\npetitioner Atlanta Falcons (Falcons) from April 2006 until his retirement in\nFebruary 2009.\n            Six years after he retired, Gandy filed a claim in California for\nworkers’ compensation, claiming a cumulative injury to multiple body parts.\nThe workers’ compensation judge (WCJ) who heard Gandy’s claim issued an\nopinion determining the Falcons were exempted from liability under\nCalifornia workers’ compensation law pursuant to Labor Code section 3600.5,\n                         1\nsubdivisions (c) and (d). The WCJ’s opinion also determined Gandy was\n                                                       2\nexempted from coverage under the same provisions. The Workers’\nCompensation Appeals Board (the WCAB), on reconsideration, determined it\nhad jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim and rescinded the WCJ’s opinion.\n            We find the Falcons are exempted under sections 3600.5(c) and\n(d). The WCAB’s opinion and decision after reconsideration is therefore\n\n\n            1\n               All further statutory references are to the Labor Code. For ease\nof reference, subdivisions (a), (c), and (d) of section 3600.5 will be referred to\nas sections 3600.5(a), 3600.5(c), and 3600.5(d).\n\n            2\n              The WCAB opinion did not address the liability of any team\nother than the Falcons. Our opinion is correspondingly limited to the issue of\nthe Falcons’ liability under California workers’ compensation law.\n\n                                        2\n\fannulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                    FACTS\n            In September 2015, Gandy filed a claim for workers’\ncompensation with the State of California, asserting he suffered a cumulative\ninjury during his 15 seasons with the NFL. He initially named the LA Rams\nand the STL Rams as his employers, but later added the Steelers, the Saints,\nand the Falcons as additional employers.\n            In June 2019, Gandy’s claim went to trial on three issues: (1)\nwhether California has jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim; (2) whether\njurisdiction should be exercised in light of the choice of law and forum\nselection clauses in Gandy’s contracts with the Falcons and the Saints\n(McKinley v. Arizona Cardinals (2013) 78 Cal.Comp.Cases 23); and (3)\nwhether Gandy’s claim against the Falcons was barred by the applicable\nstatutes of limitation.\n\n            The following evidence was either stipulated to by the parties or\npresented at trial. Gandy was employed by the LA Rams from July 1994 to\nsometime in 1995, the STL Rams from sometime in 1995 to February 1999,\nthe Steelers from April 1999 to February 2003, the Saints from March 2003\nto April 2006, and the Falcons from April 2006 to February 2009. The\ncontract Gandy signed with the LA Rams in California covered his\nemployment both with the LA Rams and the STL Rams. During his years\nwith the STL Rams, Gandy played a total of seven games in California.\nDuring the last decade of his employment as a professional football player,\nGandy played a total of eight games in California—two with the Steelers,\nfour with the Saints, and two with the Falcons. In addition, Gandy spent a\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fweek of practice in California during his three-year employment with the\nSaints.\n            The WCJ issued an opinion finding the Falcons provided workers’\ncompensation insurance coverage for Gandy under the laws of a state other\nthan California and that such insurance provided coverage for Gandy in\nGeorgia and California for all the relevant time Gandy was working for the\nFalcons. Based on the stipulated facts and evidence, the WCJ found both\nGandy and the Falcons were exempted from the provisions of California’s\n                                                            3\nworkers’ compensation law pursuant to section 3600.5. Gandy successfully\npetitioned for reconsideration by the WCAB.\n\n            The WCAB issued an opinion and decision after reconsideration\n(the WCAB opinion), that rescinded the WCJ’s order and found the WCAB\nhad jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim. The WCAB took the position, in line with\nits previous decision in Hansell v. Arizona Diamondbacks (2022) 87\nCal.Comp.Cases 602, that it has jurisdiction under section 3600.5(a) over any\nathlete who ever signed a contract in California or with a California team,\nregardless of subdivisions (c) or (d), and it therefore had jurisdiction over\nGandy’s claim because, during his first season in the NFL, he signed a\ncontract with a California team. The WCAB also determined any choice of\n                                                        4\nlaw/forum selection clause(s) should not be enforced.\n            The Falcons petitioned this court for a writ of review. We granted\nthe petition.\n\n            3\n             The WCJ’s opinion did not address whether the Steelers or the\nSaints were exempted.\n\n            4\n            The WCAB opinion deferred deciding whether Gandy’s claim for\ncompensation was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in section\n5405.\n\n                                        4\n\f                                  DISCUSSION\n                                         I.\n                          STATUTORY INTERPRETATION\n            The issue we must decide is one of statutory interpretation—\nspecifically, whether the Falcons are exempted from the provisions of\nCalifornia’s workers’ compensation law in connection with Gandy’s claim.\nRelying on section 3600.5(d), the WCJ determined the Falcons were\nexempted. Relying on sections 5305 and 3600.5(a), the WCAB determined it\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim regardless of sections\n3600.5(c) and (d).\n            Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.\n(Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd.\n(2025) 17 Cal.5th 510, 520.) “We begin with the text, considering the ordinary\nmeaning of the statutory language as well as the text of related provisions,\nterms used elsewhere in the statute, and the structure of the statutory\nscheme. [Citation.] If the text is clear, we must give effect to it. If, however,\nthe text is ambiguous, we may consult extrinsic sources, including the\nlegislative history. [Citation.] In ascertaining the statutory meaning, we\naccord appropriate weight to the interpretations adopted by the Workers’\nCompensation Appeals Board in the course of official proceedings. [Citations.]\nBut if ‘the agency’s interpretation is clearly erroneous or unauthorized under\nthe statute, we will not give effect to its understanding of the statute.’” (Id. at\npp. 520–521.)\n            In interpreting statutory language, “[w]e do not presume that the\nLegislature performs idle acts, nor do we construe statutory provisions so as\nto render them superfluous.” (Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 22; see\nLos Angeles County Employees Retirement Assn. v. County of Los Angeles\n\n                                         5\n\f(2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1209, review granted Oct. 16, 2024, S286264\n[appellate court must “‘strive to give meaning to every word in a statute [or\ninitiative] and to avoid constructions that render words, phrases, or clauses\nsuperfluous’”].)\n            Where two statutes appear to be in conflict, “‘“[a] court must,\nwhere reasonably possible, harmonize statutes, reconcile seeming\ninconsistencies in them, and construe them to give force and effect to all of\ntheir provisions.”’” (State Dept. of Public Health v. Superior Court (2015) 60\nCal.4th 940, 955.) If the statutes cannot be harmonized, “one must be\ninterpreted as providing an exception to the other.” (Id. at p. 956.) “The rules\nwe must apply when faced with two irreconcilable statutes are well\nestablished. ‘If conflicting statutes cannot be reconciled, later enactments\nsupersede earlier ones [citation], and more specific provisions take\nprecedence over more general ones [citation].’ [Citation.] But when these two\nrules are in conflict, the rule that specific provisions take precedence over\nmore general ones trumps the rule that later-enacted statutes have\nprecedence.” (Id. at p. 960.)\n                                       II.\n    WORKERS’ COMPENSATION JURISDICTION FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES\n            The California workers’ compensation system “is solely a creation\nof the Legislature, and thus its fundamental subject matter jurisdiction is\nlimited by statute. Article [XIV], section 4, of the California Constitution\nprovides that the Legislature ‘is . . . expressly vested with plenary power,\nunlimited by any provision of this Constitution, to create, and enforce a\ncomplete system of workers’ compensation, by appropriate legislation.’\n[Citation.] Thus, in the absence of a statute affirmatively conferring subject\nmatter jurisdiction over a claim to the WCAB, it lacks the power to\n\n                                        6\n\fadjudicate that claim.” (Tripplett v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2018) 25\nCal.App.5th 556, 562.)\n            Pursuant to the power granted by Article XIV, section 4, “the\nLegislature enacted the [Workers’ Compensation Act]—a comprehensive\nstatutory scheme governing compensation given to California employees for\ninjuries incurred in the course and scope of their employment. (§ 3201 et\nseq.)” (Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2001) 24\nCal.4th 800, 810.)\n            California’s workers’ compensation coverage extends beyond\nCalifornia employees who are injured while working in California. Under\nsection 3600.5(a), employees who have entered contracts of employment in\nCalifornia or who work regularly in California and are injured while working\noutside of California are also covered. (§ 3600.5(a) [“If an employee who has\nbeen hired or is regularly working in the state receives personal injury by\naccident arising out of and in the course of employment outside of this state,\nhe or she, or his or her dependents, in the case of his or her death, shall be\nentitled to compensation according to the law of this state”]; see also § 5305\n[“The Division of Workers’ Compensation, including the administrative\ndirector, and the appeals board have jurisdiction over all controversies\narising out of injuries suffered outside the territorial limits of this state in\nthose cases where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time\nof the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state”].) Even when\nthe employment is intended to take place entirely outside of California, the\nemployee is covered by California’s workers’ compensation law for any injury\noccurring during that employment, so long as the contract of employment is\nentered into in California. (See Bowen v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1999)\n73 Cal.App.4th 15, 17, 26 (Bowen) [a California resident who “suffered an\n\n                                         7\n\finjury in Florida while playing professional baseball for a minor league team\nowned by the Florida Marlins” was covered under California workers’\ncompensation law because the player signed the contract in California].)\n                                       III.\n  CALIFORNIA WORKERS’ COMPENSATION COVERAGE GENERALLY DOES NOT\n    EXTEND TO EMPLOYEES HIRED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WHO DO NOT\n                       REGULARLY WORK IN CALIFORNIA\n            Employees hired outside of California and who do not regularly\nwork in California generally are exempted from coverage by California’s\nworkers’ compensation law, even when the employee is injured while working\nin California. (§ 3600.5, subd. (b)(1) [“An employee who has been hired\noutside of this state and his or her employer shall be exempted from the\nprovisions of this division while the employee is temporarily within the state\ndoing work for his or her employer if the employer has furnished workers’\ncompensation insurance coverage under the workers’ compensation insurance\n                                                       5\nor similar laws of a state other than California”].)\n            In 2013, the Legislature added sections 3600.5(c) and 3600.5(d) to\nsection 3600.5, to explicitly address a specific subset of workers’\ncompensation claims: cumulative injury claims by professional athletes.\n(Stats. 2013, ch. 653, § 1.) Section 3600.5(c) reads, in pertinent part: “With\nrespect to an occupational disease or cumulative injury, a professional athlete\nwho has been hired outside of this state and his or her employer shall be\nexempted from the provisions of this division while the professional athlete is\n\n\n            5\n              The other state is also required to recognize the extraterritorial\nprovisions of California’s workers’ compensation law and to exempt\nCalifornia employers and employees from application of that state’s workers’\ncompensation law. (§ 3600.5, subds. (b)(1)(A) & (B).)\n\n                                        8\n\ftemporarily within this state doing work for his or her employer if” the\nemployer provides workers’ compensation or its equivalent for the athlete\nunder the laws of another state and that compensation covers the athlete’s\nemployment in this state. (Id., subd. (c)(1).) In such a case, “the benefits\nunder the workers’ compensation insurance or similar laws of the other state,\nand other remedies under those laws, shall be the exclusive remedy against\nthe employer for any . . . cumulative injury . . . .” (Id., subd. (c)(2), italics\nadded.) A professional athlete is “temporarily within” California if he or she\n“performs less than 20 percent of his or her duty days in California” “during\nthe 365 consecutive days immediately preceding” the last day of work for that\nemployer within California. (Id., subd. (c)(3).)\n             Gandy’s last day of work for the Falcons in California was a\nNovember 30, 2008 game against the San Diego Chargers. In the 365 days\npreceding that date, Gandy’s total duty days included four games and at least\n250 practice days. None of the practices and only one of the games was in\nCalifornia—less than 20 percent of Gandy’s duty days during the relevant\nperiod. The Falcons are therefore exempt under the terms of section\n3600.5(c).\n             But that is not the end of the inquiry. As the WCAB recognized,\nGandy was, in fact, hired as a professional football player in California (albeit\nby the LA Rams, not by the Falcons) at one point early in his 15-year NFL\ncareer. Therefore, section 3600.5(c) raises a question: what happens when a\nprofessional athlete is hired both by California and non-California teams over\nthe course of his or her career and suffers a cumulative injury or occupational\ndisease arising from that career?\n             Section 3600.5(d) provides a clear answer. It specifies that both a\nprofessional athlete claiming a cumulative injury and his or her employer are\n\n                                           9\n\fexempted when “all of the professional athlete’s employers in his or her last\nyear of work as a professional athlete are exempt from this division pursuant\nto subdivision (c) or any other law, unless both the following conditions are\nsatisfied”: (1) “[t]he professional athlete has, over the course of his or her\nprofessional athletic career, worked for two or more seasons for a California-\nbased team” or “worked 20 percent or more of his or her duty days either in\nCalifornia or for a California-based team” and (2) the professional athlete has\n“worked for fewer than seven seasons for any team or teams other than a\nCalifornia-based team or teams.” (§ 3600.5, subd. (d)(1).)\n            In other words, if all the employers in the last year of an athlete’s\ncareer are exempt—under section 3600.5(c) or otherwise—the athlete’s career\nis not governed by California worker’s compensation law unless the athlete\nsatisfies two conditions: (1) he or she spent either two or more seasons or 20\npercent of his or her total career working in California or for a California-\nbased team; and (2) he or she spent fewer than seven total seasons working\nfor any non-California team or teams. Gandy fails both tests. He was\nemployed for 15 seasons, only one of which was in California with a\nCalifornia based team, and he worked fewer than 20 percent of his duty days\nin California or for a California-based team. Therefore, section 3600.5(d)\nexempts both Gandy and the Falcons from California worker’s compensation\nlaw.\n                                        IV.\n                         INTERPRETING SECTION 3600.5\n            Looking at section 3600.5, the WCAB opinion found an ambiguity\nbetween section 3600.5(a)—which provides coverage for California employees\ninjured while working outside of California—and sections 3600.5(c) and (d),\nwhich set forth exemptions from coverage for cumulative injuries suffered by\n\n                                        10\n\fprofessional athletes. Specifically, the WCAB opinion concluded: “the phrase\n‘a professional athlete who has been hired outside of this state’ in section\n3600.5, subdivision (c) is ambiguous as applied to a claim like [Gandy’s],\nwhere the applicant has California contracts of hire, but not with the\nparticular employer that is asserted to be exempt pursuant to the\nsubdivision.”\n            After examining the legislative history relating to sections\n3600.5(c) and (d), the WCAB determined “the Legislature did not intend for\n[sections 3600.5(c) and (d)] to apply to athletes who have been hired in\nCalifornia by at least one employer during the cumulative trauma injury\n        6\nperiod.” The WCAB’s interpretation is fundamentally flawed.\n\n\n            6\n               In reviewing the legislative history, the WCAB relied heavily on\nthe Legislature’s stated desire not to “impact or alter in any way the decision\nof the court in [Bowen]”. (Stats. 2013, ch. 653, § 3.) The WCAB argues this\nshows the Legislature did not intend sections 3600.5(c) and (d) to apply to\nprofessional athletes who had been hired in California at any time during\nwhat the WCAB called the “cumulative trauma injury period.” Bowen,\nhowever, did not address either a cumulative injury claim or a player hired\nby more than one team. Rather, it addressed whether Bowen, a California\nresident who entered into a player’s contract in California and was injured in\na game in Florida while playing for a Florida team, was covered by California\nworkers’ compensation. The court answered that question in the affirmative:\n“we conclude that under sections 3600.5 and 5305 an employee who is a\nprofessional athlete residing in California, such as Bowen, who signs a\nplayer’s contract in California furnished to the athlete here by an out-of-state\nteam, is entitled to benefits under the act for injuries received while playing\nout of state under the contract. This is so even though the team has not yet\nsigned the contract . . . .” (Bowen, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 27, italics\nadded.) Had Gandy’s career ended after his seasons with the LA Rams and\nSTL Rams, Bowen would control and his claim would be viable before the\nCalifornia WCAB. Instead, his career continued for many years with other,\nnon-California teams under contracts entered in other states, distinguishing\nhis situation from that in Bowen.\n\n                                       11\n\f            The overriding problem with the WCAB’s interpretation is that it\nrenders superfluous the plain language of section 3600.5(d), which\nspecifically addresses professional athletes who ultimately suffer a\ncumulative injury after having been hired by one or more California-based\nteams at some point in their career. A “‘California-based team’” is one that\nplays a majority of its home games in California. (§ 3600.5, subd. (g)(1).)\nUnder sections 3600.5(c) and (d), a professional athlete claiming a cumulative\ninjury who has worked for both a California employer and other employers is\nexempted from coverage under California’s workers’ compensation law if all\nthe teams in his or her final year of employment as a professional athlete are\nexempt, unless the athlete worked for fewer than seven total seasons for non-\nCalifornia teams and worked for California teams or in California for at least\ntwo seasons or 20 percent of his or her total career duty days. Under the plain\nlanguage of sections 3600.5(c) and (d), a single California contract or a single\nseason of full-time, regular work in California is not, by itself, enough. The\nWCAB’s interpretation completely (and improperly) ignores this statutory\nlanguage. (Shoemaker v. Myers, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 22 [we do not “construe\nstatutory provisions so as to render them superfluous”].)\n            The WCAB contends its reading of the statute does not render\nsection 3600.5(d) superfluous because it could still apply in a situation in\nwhich the employee is hired by a California-based team, but under a contract\nentered in another state, with the employee assigned to play for an out-of-\nstate affiliate, such that he or she does not regularly work in California. This\nargument strains credulity.\n            Significantly, in determining whether a particular contract is a\nCalifornia contract for hire, California courts ordinarily apply a liberal\nconstruction of both the law and the facts in favor of finding California\n\n                                       12\n\fjurisdiction. (Bowen, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 25.) The Bowen court\nexplained through a series of examples that this rule allows even a relatively\nminimal connection between the contract and the State of California to be\nsufficient to construe the contract as a California contract for hire, even if the\ntypical rules of contract interpretation would deem the contract to have been\nmade somewhere else. (Id. at pp. 20–25.) Accordingly, it is unlikely a\nCalifornia-based team would ever be determined to have entered a non-\nCalifornia contract for hire, for the simple reason that the California-based\nteam’s location in California would supply the necessary connection to\nCalifornia to deem the contract a California contract.\n            The Legislature’s purpose in enacting section 3600.5(c) and (d)\nwas to limit the extent to which California workers’ compensation benefits\nwould be available to professional athletes suffering from cumulative injuries\nsuffered over a course of years. More specifically, the legislature’s purpose\nwas to “essentially prohibit[] professional athletes employed by out of state\nteams from filing California workers’ compensation claims,” while “allow[ing]\nsome of these athletes who have defined prior contacts with California teams\nto file claims.” (Assem. Conc. Sen. Amends. to Assem. Bill No. 1309 (2013–\n2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 5, 2013, p. 3.) Interpreting section 3600.5\nin the manner proposed by the WCAB would fly in the face of this purpose by\nallowing any athlete with a cumulative injury who was ever hired by a\nCalifornia-based team to assert a claim in California. It also flies in the face\nof the statutory language itself, as section 3600.5(d) clearly contemplates that\nsome athletes who previously worked for California-based teams in California\nwill not be covered.\n            Moreover, even if sections 3600.5(a), (c), and (d) were in conflict\n(and we do not find they are), sections 3600.5(c) and (d), as the later and more\n\n                                       13\n\fspecific enactments, would take precedence over the earlier and more general\nsection 3600.5(a). (State Dept. of Public Health v. Superior Court, supra, 60\nCal.4th at pp. 960–961.)\n            The Falcons are exempted from California’s workers’\n                                                                           7\ncompensation law in connection with Gandy’s claimed cumulative injury.\n                                DISPOSITION\n            The WCAB opinion is annulled, and the matter is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Falcons shall recover\ncosts on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                           GOODING, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nSANCHEZ, ACTING P. J.\n\n\n\nDELANEY, J.\n\n\n\n\n            7\n              This finding renders moot the remaining issues tried before the\nWCJ, namely: (1) whether the WCAB should honor the choice of law/forum\nselection provisions in Gandy’s contract with the Falcons, and (2) whether\nGandy’s claim is time-barred. It also makes it unnecessary for us to address\nthe Falcons’ argument that due process would preclude application of\nCalifornia workers’ compensation law to it with respect to its hiring of Gandy\nin Georgia, for work to be performed primarily in Georgia.\n\n                                      14\n\f",

LaFrancis,\nJr., for Respondent Wayne Gandy.\n\f            Wayne Gandy spent 15 years—from 1994 to 2009—as a\nprofessional football player with the National Football League (NFL). He\nplayed with the Los Angeles Rams (LA Rams) during the 1994 season, his\nfirst with the NFL. He played the next three years with the St. Louis Rams\n(STL Rams) under the contract he had signed in California with the LA\nRams, but he never again played for a California team. He played for the\nPittsburgh Steelers (Steelers) from April 1999 to February 2003, the New\nOrleans Saints (Saints) from March 2003 to April 2006, and finally,\npetitioner Atlanta Falcons (Falcons) from April 2006 until his retirement in\nFebruary 2009.\n            Six years after he retired, Gandy filed a claim in California for\nworkers’ compensation, claiming a cumulative injury to multiple body parts.\nThe workers’ compensation judge (WCJ) who heard Gandy’s claim issued an\nopinion determining the Falcons were exempted from liability under\nCalifornia workers’ compensation law pursuant to Labor Code section 3600.5,\n                         1\nsubdivisions (c) and (d). The WCJ’s opinion also determined Gandy was\n                                                       2\nexempted from coverage under the same provisions. The Workers’\nCompensation Appeals Board (the WCAB), on reconsideration, determined it\nhad jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim and rescinded the WCJ’s opinion.\n            We find the Falcons are exempted under sections 3600.5(c) and\n(d). The WCAB’s opinion and decision after reconsideration is therefore\n\n\n            1\n               All further statutory references are to the Labor Code. For ease\nof reference, subdivisions (a), (c), and (d) of section 3600.5 will be referred to\nas sections 3600.5(a), 3600.5(c), and 3600.5(d).\n\n            2\n              The WCAB opinion did not address the liability of any team\nother than the Falcons. Our opinion is correspondingly limited to the issue of\nthe Falcons’ liability under California workers’ compensation law.\n\n                                        2\n\fannulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                    FACTS\n            In September 2015, Gandy filed a claim for workers’\ncompensation with the State of California, asserting he suffered a cumulative\ninjury during his 15 seasons with the NFL. He initially named the LA Rams\nand the STL Rams as his employers, but later added the Steelers, the Saints,\nand the Falcons as additional employers.\n            In June 2019, Gandy’s claim went to trial on three issues: (1)\nwhether California has jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim; (2) whether\njurisdiction should be exercised in light of the choice of law and forum\nselection clauses in Gandy’s contracts with the Falcons and the Saints\n(McKinley v. Arizona Cardinals (2013) 78 Cal.Comp.Cases 23); and (3)\nwhether Gandy’s claim against the Falcons was barred by the applicable\nstatutes of limitation.\n\n            The following evidence was either stipulated to by the parties or\npresented at trial. Gandy was employed by the LA Rams from July 1994 to\nsometime in 1995, the STL Rams from sometime in 1995 to February 1999,\nthe Steelers from April 1999 to February 2003, the Saints from March 2003\nto April 2006, and the Falcons from April 2006 to February 2009. The\ncontract Gandy signed with the LA Rams in California covered his\nemployment both with the LA Rams and the STL Rams. During his years\nwith the STL Rams, Gandy played a total of seven games in California.\nDuring the last decade of his employment as a professional football player,\nGandy played a total of eight games in California—two with the Steelers,\nfour with the Saints, and two with the Falcons. In addition, Gandy spent a\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fweek of practice in California during his three-year employment with the\nSaints.\n            The WCJ issued an opinion finding the Falcons provided workers’\ncompensation insurance coverage for Gandy under the laws of a state other\nthan California and that such insurance provided coverage for Gandy in\nGeorgia and California for all the relevant time Gandy was working for the\nFalcons. Based on the stipulated facts and evidence, the WCJ found both\nGandy and the Falcons were exempted from the provisions of California’s\n                                                            3\nworkers’ compensation law pursuant to section 3600.5. Gandy successfully\npetitioned for reconsideration by the WCAB.\n\n            The WCAB issued an opinion and decision after reconsideration\n(the WCAB opinion), that rescinded the WCJ’s order and found the WCAB\nhad jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim. The WCAB took the position, in line with\nits previous decision in Hansell v. Arizona Diamondbacks (2022) 87\nCal.Comp.Cases 602, that it has jurisdiction under section 3600.5(a) over any\nathlete who ever signed a contract in California or with a California team,\nregardless of subdivisions (c) or (d), and it therefore had jurisdiction over\nGandy’s claim because, during his first season in the NFL, he signed a\ncontract with a California team. The WCAB also determined any choice of\n                                                        4\nlaw/forum selection clause(s) should not be enforced.\n            The Falcons petitioned this court for a writ of review. We granted\nthe petition.\n\n            3\n             The WCJ’s opinion did not address whether the Steelers or the\nSaints were exempted.\n\n            4\n            The WCAB opinion deferred deciding whether Gandy’s claim for\ncompensation was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in section\n5405.\n\n                                        4\n\f                                  DISCUSSION\n                                         I.\n                          STATUTORY INTERPRETATION\n            The issue we must decide is one of statutory interpretation—\nspecifically, whether the Falcons are exempted from the provisions of\nCalifornia’s workers’ compensation law in connection with Gandy’s claim.\nRelying on section 3600.5(d), the WCJ determined the Falcons were\nexempted. Relying on sections 5305 and 3600.5(a), the WCAB determined it\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim regardless of sections\n3600.5(c) and (d).\n            Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.\n(Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation v.

If the statutes cannot be harmonized, “one must be\ninterpreted as providing an exception to the other.” (Id. at p. 956.) “The rules\nwe must apply when faced with two irreconcilable statutes are well\nestablished. ‘If conflicting statutes cannot be reconciled, later enactments\nsupersede earlier ones [citation], and more specific provisions take\nprecedence over more general ones [citation].’ [Citation.] But when these two\nrules are in conflict, the rule that specific provisions take precedence over\nmore general ones trumps the rule that later-enacted statutes have\nprecedence.” (Id. at p. 960.)\n                                       II.\n    WORKERS’ COMPENSATION JURISDICTION FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES\n            The California workers’ compensation system “is solely a creation\nof the Legislature, and thus its fundamental subject matter jurisdiction is\nlimited by statute.

(§ 3600.5(a) [“If an employee who has\nbeen hired or is regularly working in the state receives personal injury by\naccident arising out of and in the course of employment outside of this state,\nhe or she, or his or her dependents, in the case of his or her death, shall be\nentitled to compensation according to the law of this state”]; see also § 5305\n[“The Division of Workers’ Compensation, including the administrative\ndirector, and the appeals board have jurisdiction over all controversies\narising out of injuries suffered outside the territorial limits of this state in\nthose cases where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time\nof the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state”].) Even when\nthe employment is intended to take place entirely outside of California, the\nemployee is covered by California’s workers’ compensation law for any injury\noccurring during that employment, so long as the contract of employment is\nentered into in California.

Section 3600.5(c) reads, in pertinent part: “With\nrespect to an occupational disease or cumulative injury, a professional athlete\nwho has been hired outside of this state and his or her employer shall be\nexempted from the provisions of this division while the professional athlete is\n\n\n            5\n              The other state is also required to recognize the extraterritorial\nprovisions of California’s workers’ compensation law and to exempt\nCalifornia employers and employees from application of that state’s workers’\ncompensation law. (§ 3600.5, subds. (b)(1)(A) &amp; (B).)\n\n                                        8\n\ftemporarily within this state doing work for his or her employer if” the\nemployer provides workers’ compensation or its equivalent for the athlete\nunder the laws of another state and that compensation covers the athlete’s\nemployment in this state. (Id., subd. (c)(1).) In such a case, “the benefits\nunder the workers’ compensation insurance or similar laws of the other state,\nand other remedies under those laws, shall be the exclusive remedy against\nthe employer for any . . . cumulative injury . . . .” (Id., subd. (c)(2), italics\nadded.) A professional athlete is “temporarily within” California if he or she\n“performs less than 20 percent of his or her duty days in California” “during\nthe 365 consecutive days immediately preceding” the last day of work for that\nemployer within California. (Id., subd. (c)(3).)\n             Gandy’s last day of work for the Falcons in California was a\nNovember 30, 2008 game against the San Diego Chargers. In the 365 days\npreceding that date, Gandy’s total duty days included four games and at least\n250 practice days. None of the practices and only one of the games was in\nCalifornia—less than 20 percent of Gandy’s duty days during the relevant\nperiod. The Falcons are therefore exempt under the terms of section\n3600.5(c).\n             But that is not the end of the inquiry. As the WCAB recognized,\nGandy was, in fact, hired as a professional football player in California (albeit\nby the LA Rams, not by the Falcons) at one point early in his 15-year NFL\ncareer. Therefore, section 3600.5(c) raises a question: what happens when a\nprofessional athlete is hired both by California and non-California teams over\nthe course of his or her career and suffers a cumulative injury or occupational\ndisease arising from that career?\n             Section 3600.5(d) provides a clear answer. It specifies that both a\nprofessional athlete claiming a cumulative injury and his or her employer are\n\n                                           9\n\fexempted when “all of the professional athlete’s employers in his or her last\nyear of work as a professional athlete are exempt from this division pursuant\nto subdivision (c) or any other law, unless both the following conditions are\nsatisfied”: (1) “[t]he professional athlete has, over the course of his or her\nprofessional athletic career, worked for two or more seasons for a California-\nbased team” or “worked 20 percent or more of his or her duty days either in\nCalifornia or for a California-based team” and (2) the professional athlete has\n“worked for fewer than seven seasons for any team or teams other than a\nCalifornia-based team or teams.” (§ 3600.5, subd. (d)(1).)\n            In other words, if all the employers in the last year of an athlete’s\ncareer are exempt—under section 3600.5(c) or otherwise—the athlete’s career\nis not governed by California worker’s compensation law unless the athlete\nsatisfies two conditions: (1) he or she spent either two or more seasons or 20\npercent of his or her total career working in California or for a California-\nbased team; and (2) he or she spent fewer than seven total seasons working\nfor any non-California team or teams. Gandy fails both tests. He was\nemployed for 15 seasons, only one of which was in California with a\nCalifornia based team, and he worked fewer than 20 percent of his duty days\nin California or for a California-based team. Therefore, section 3600.5(d)\nexempts both Gandy and the Falcons from California worker’s compensation\nlaw.\n                                        IV.\n                         INTERPRETING SECTION 3600.5\n            Looking at section 3600.5, the WCAB opinion found an ambiguity\nbetween section 3600.5(a)—which provides coverage for California employees\ninjured while working outside of California—and sections 3600.5(c) and (d),\nwhich set forth exemptions from coverage for cumulative injuries suffered by\n\n                                        10\n\fprofessional athletes. Specifically, the WCAB opinion concluded: “the phrase\n‘a professional athlete who has been hired outside of this state’ in section\n3600.5, subdivision (c) is ambiguous as applied to a claim like [Gandy’s],\nwhere the applicant has California contracts of hire, but not with the\nparticular employer that is asserted to be exempt pursuant to the\nsubdivision.”\n            After examining the legislative history relating to sections\n3600.5(c) and (d), the WCAB determined “the Legislature did not intend for\n[sections 3600.5(c) and (d)] to apply to athletes who have been hired in\nCalifornia by at least one employer during the cumulative trauma injury\n        6\nperiod.” The WCAB’s interpretation is fundamentally flawed.\n\n\n            6\n               In reviewing the legislative history, the WCAB relied heavily on\nthe Legislature’s stated desire not to “impact or alter in any way the decision\nof the court in [Bowen]”. (Stats. 2013, ch. 653, § 3.) The WCAB argues this\nshows the Legislature did not intend sections 3600.5(c) and (d) to apply to\nprofessional athletes who had been hired in California at any time during\nwhat the WCAB called the “cumulative trauma injury period.” Bowen,\nhowever, did not address either a cumulative injury claim or a player hired\nby more than one team. Rather, it addressed whether Bowen, a California\nresident who entered into a player’s contract in California and was injured in\na game in Florida while playing for a Florida team, was covered by California\nworkers’ compensation. The court answered that question in the affirmative:\n“we conclude that under sections 3600.5 and 5305 an employee who is a\nprofessional athlete residing in California, such as Bowen, who signs a\nplayer’s contract in California furnished to the athlete here by an out-of-state\nteam, is entitled to benefits under the act for injuries received while playing\nout of state under the contract. This is so even though the team has not yet\nsigned the contract . . . .” (Bowen, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9750198\"><a href=\"/opinion/2289408/bowen-v-workers-compensation-appeals-board/#27\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Bowen v. Workers&#x27; Compensation Appeals Board\">73 Cal.App.4th at p. 27</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, italics\nadded.) Had Gandy’s career ended after his seasons with the LA Rams and\nSTL Rams, Bowen would control and his claim would be viable before the\nCalifornia WCAB. Instead, his career continued for many years with other,\nnon-California teams under contracts entered in other states, distinguishing\nhis situation from that in Bowen.\n\n                                       11\n\f            The overriding problem with the WCAB’s interpretation is that it\nrenders superfluous the plain language of section 3600.5(d), which\nspecifically addresses professional athletes who ultimately suffer a\ncumulative injury after having been hired by one or more California-based\nteams at some point in their career. A “‘California-based team’” is one that\nplays a majority of its home games in California. (§ 3600.5, subd. (g)(1).)\nUnder sections 3600.5(c) and (d), a professional athlete claiming a cumulative\ninjury who has worked for both a California employer and other employers is\nexempted from coverage under California’s workers’ compensation law if all\nthe teams in his or her final year of employment as a professional athlete are\nexempt, unless the athlete worked for fewer than seven total seasons for non-\nCalifornia teams and worked for California teams or in California for at least\ntwo seasons or 20 percent of his or her total career duty days. Under the plain\nlanguage of sections 3600.5(c) and (d), a single California contract or a single\nseason of full-time, regular work in California is not, by itself, enough. The\nWCAB’s interpretation completely (and improperly) ignores this statutory\nlanguage. (Shoemaker v. Myers, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1441972\"><a href=\"/opinion/1441972/shoemaker-v-myers/#22\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Shoemaker v. Myers\">52 Cal.3d at p. 22</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [we do not “construe\nstatutory provisions so as to render them superfluous”].)\n            The WCAB contends its reading of the statute does not render\nsection 3600.5(d) superfluous because it could still apply in a situation in\nwhich the employee is hired by a California-based team, but under a contract\nentered in another state, with the employee assigned to play for an out-of-\nstate affiliate, such that he or she does not regularly work in California. This\nargument strains credulity.\n            Significantly, in determining whether a particular contract is a\nCalifornia contract for hire, California courts ordinarily apply a liberal\nconstruction of both the law and the facts in favor of finding California\n\n                                       12\n\fjurisdiction. (Bowen, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9750198\"><a href=\"/opinion/2289408/bowen-v-workers-compensation-appeals-board/#25\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Bowen v. Workers&#x27; Compensation Appeals Board\">73 Cal.App.4th at p. 25</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) The Bowen court\nexplained through a series of examples that this rule allows even a relatively\nminimal connection between the contract and the State of California to be\nsufficient to construe the contract as a California contract for hire, even if the\ntypical rules of contract interpretation would deem the contract to have been\nmade somewhere else. (Id. at pp. 20–25.) Accordingly, it is unlikely a\nCalifornia-based team would ever be determined to have entered a non-\nCalifornia contract for hire, for the simple reason that the California-based\nteam’s location in California would supply the necessary connection to\nCalifornia to deem the contract a California contract.\n            The Legislature’s purpose in enacting section 3600.5(c) and (d)\nwas to limit the extent to which California workers’ compensation benefits\nwould be available to professional athletes suffering from cumulative injuries\nsuffered over a course of years. More specifically, the legislature’s purpose\nwas to “essentially prohibit[] professional athletes employed by out of state\nteams from filing California workers’ compensation claims,” while “allow[ing]\nsome of these athletes who have defined prior contacts with California teams\nto file claims.” (Assem. Conc. Sen. Amends. to Assem. Bill No. 1309 (2013–\n2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 5, 2013, p. 3.) Interpreting section 3600.5\nin the manner proposed by the WCAB would fly in the face of this purpose by\nallowing any athlete with a cumulative injury who was ever hired by a\nCalifornia-based team to assert a claim in California. It also flies in the face\nof the statutory language itself, as section 3600.5(d) clearly contemplates that\nsome athletes who previously worked for California-based teams in California\nwill not be covered.\n            Moreover, even if sections 3600.5(a), (c), and (d) were in conflict\n(and we do not find they are), sections 3600.5(c) and (d), as the later and more\n\n                                       13\n\fspecific enactments, would take precedence over the earlier and more general\nsection 3600.5(a).

State Farm issued Diblin a\nhomeowners policy that covered injuries arising from an “occurrence,” which\nthe policy defined as “an accident.” While the policy was in effect, Diblin\nattacked Gagliardo, who was one of his housemates, by striking her over the\nhead with a mallet multiple times. Gagliardo sued Diblin to recover\neconomic and noneconomic damages. A jury found in her favor on two\ntheories of liability and awarded her more than $2.5 million dollars in\ncompensatory damages.\n      Before the jury’s verdict in the underlying action was reduced to a\njudgment, State Farm filed this declaratory relief action against Gagliardo\nand Diblin. State Farm sought a determination that it owed no duty to\nindemnify Diblin for the amount of Gagliardo’s judgment. After reviewing\nthe pleadings, the jury instructions, and the special verdict form, the trial\ncourt determined the findings of the jury in the underlying action\nconclusively established that Diblin’s injury-producing conduct was not the\nresult of an “accident,” and Gagliardo’s damages therefore did not arise from\na covered “occurrence” under the policy. The court entered judgment in favor\nof State Farm on its complaint for declaratory relief.\n      On appeal, Diblin and Gagliardo contend the trial court erred in\ninterpreting the findings of the jury in the underlying action and in\nconcluding the underlying damage award is not covered by Diblin’s policy.\nWe affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f                                       II.\n                                BACKGROUND\nA.    The Injury-Producing Event and Diblin’s Criminal Prosecution\n      In May 2015, Diblin and Gagliardo were housemates and friends. On\nthe morning of May 23, 2015, Gagliardo visited Diblin in his bedroom to use\nhis coffee machine and computer, as she had done on other occasions.\nGagliardo sat in a chair to check her e-mail while Diblin stood behind her.\n“All of a sudden,” Gagliardo felt something that made her think “the ceiling\nfell down on [her] head.” After a moment, she realized Diblin was beating\nher over the head with a rubber mallet. Diblin struck her multiple times.\n      Police arrested Diblin, and he was criminally prosecuted. He\nultimately pled guilty to one count of assault with intent to commit a sexual\ncrime and admitted great bodily injury and dangerous weapon\nenhancements.\nB.    The Pleadings in the Underlying Action\n      On November 6, 2015, Gagliardo filed a civil action against Diblin in\nGagliardo v. Diblin, San Diego Superior Court case No. 37-2015-00037520\n(Gagliardo v. Diblin or the underlying action). In her first amended\ncomplaint, Gagliardo asserted causes of action for sexual assault, sexual\nbattery, gender violence (Civ. Code, § 52.4), violation of the Ralph Civil\nRights Act of 1976 (Civ. Code, § 51.7; the Ralph Act), violation of the Tom\nBane Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, § 52.1; the Bane Act), sexual harassment,\nand negligence. Each of the first amended complaint’s seven causes of action,\nincluding the claim for negligence, asserted entitlement to relief based on the\nsame asserted conduct–Diblin’s attack on Gagliardo.\n      For example, as to the negligence cause of action, the first amended\ncomplaint alleged Diblin “breached [the] duty of care” he owed to Gagliardo\n\n\n                                        3\n\f“by battering and sexually assaulting” her, as set out in other paragraphs in\nthe pleading. In those referenced paragraphs, Gagliardo alleged Diblin,\n“came up behind her, without provocation, and began bludgeoning her in the\nback of the head with a hardened rubber mallet” approximately “three [to]\nfive times.” Gagliardo further alleged Diblin “dragged” her “from the chair\nand threw [her] on the floor,” after which he “punched her in the head with a\nclosed fist.” According to the allegations, Diblin also “removed [Gagliardo’s]\nrobe and groped her right breast,” and then “kissed [her] left cheek.”\nGagliardo additionally alleged that when she attempted to get away, he\n“grabbed [her] in a wrestling hold and laid on top of her on the bed.”\n      Gagliardo alleged she suffered a variety of physical and emotional\ninjuries “due to the sexual harassment, battery, and assault she suffered at\nthe hands of Diblin” (some capitalization omitted). In addition, she alleged\nDiblin’s “aforementioned conduct” “was done with malice and intent to\ninjure,” such that she was entitled to punitive damages.\n      The first amended complaint alleged no other factual or legal basis for\nthe negligence cause of action. The complaint made no mention of Diblin’s\nuse of prescription testosterone, nor did it assert a breach of due care\ninvolving the failure to monitor or warn of the side effects related to the\ntestosterone medication Diblin was prescribed.\n      The operative pleading at the time the jury rendered its verdict and\njudgment was entered was the first amended complaint.\nC.    The Policy\n\n      Diblin tendered the underlying action to State Farm under\nHomeowners Policy No. 03-BZ-A489-7 (the Policy).\n      The Policy provided Diblin liability coverage under the following\nlanguage:\n\n                                        4\n\f   “SECTION II – LIABILITY COVERAGES\n\n   “COVERAGE L - PERSONAL LIABILITY\n\n   “If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured\n   for damages because of bodily injury or property damage to\n   which this coverage applies, caused by an occurrence, we\n   will:\n\n   “1. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which\n   the insured is legally liable; and\n\n   “2. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our\n   choice. We may make any investigation and settle any\n   claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our obligation\n   to defend any claim or suit ends when the amount we pay\n   for damages, to effect settlement or satisfy a judgment\n   resulting from the occurrence, equals our limit of liability.\n\nThe Policy defined an “occurrence” as follows:\n   “FE-3419\n   DEFINITIONS\n\n   “Definitions 6. and 7. are replaced by the following:\n\n   “[¶] . . . [¶]\n\n   “7. ‘occurrence’, when used in Section II of this policy,\n   means an accident, including exposure to conditions, which\n   first results in:\n\n   “a. bodily injury; or\n\n   “b. property damage;\n\n   “during the policy period. All bodily injury and property\n   damage resulting from one accident, series of related\n   accidents or from continuous and repeated exposure to the\n   same general conditions is considered to be one occurrence.”\n   (Italics added.)\n\n                                 5\n\f      In Section II, the Policy also included an exclusion for damages caused\nby willful or intentional conduct:\n           “SECTION II – EXCLUSIONS\n\n           “1. Coverage L and Coverage M do not apply to:\n\n           “a. bodily injury or property damage:\n\n           “(1) which is either expected or intended by the insured; or\n\n           “(2) which is the result of willful and malicious acts of the\n           insured.”\n\n      State Farm accepted Diblin’s tender and agreed to provide a defense,\nsubject to a reservation of rights.\nD.    The Trial and Outcome in Gagliardo v. Diblin\n      1.      The Evidence\n      The Gagliardo v. Diblin action proceeded to trial in January 2018.\nGagliardo testified about the attack consistent with the allegations of the\nfirst amended complaint. As she testified, the attack was “a sadomasochistic\nbeating” and “an attempted rape.”\n      Diblin’s videotaped deposition was introduced at trial. He described his\nview of what happened the morning of the attack and admitted that he had\nused a mallet to hit Gagliardo on the head three times in quick succession.\nDiblin denied all of Gagliardo’s allegations that the attack involved sexual\ntouching or that he had made sexual comments or engaged in other behavior\nthat could have been interpreted as sexual in nature, such as trying to take\noff his own shorts. He indicated he pled guilty to the charge of assault with\nintent to commit a sexual offense because he was facing multiple serious\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fcharges, and he admitted to an offense that would result in a lesser sentence\nthan if he were to be found guilty of the charged counts.\n      Diblin also called Dr. Alan Abrams, a forensic psychiatrist, to support\nhis defense. Dr. Abrams acknowledged that Diblin admitted having hit\nGagliardo. Dr. Abrams opined that Diblin’s violent behavior that morning\nwas due to a “hypomanic episode attributable to the external testosterone”\nDiblin was taking as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. It was his\nview that Diblin “flew” into rage due to his testosterone-induced “irritable,\nagitated, hypomanic state.”\n      2.    The Jury Instructions\n      The court instructed the jury in connection with each of six theories of\nliability that corresponded with five of the causes of action asserted in first\namended complaint: sexual assault, sexual battery, gender violence, violation\nof the Ralph Act based on threats of violence, violation of the Ralph Act based\n\non acts of violence, and negligence. 1 The jury was not asked to decide\nwhether Diblin committed a battery or other intentional tort beyond the\nsexual and/or gender violence based intentional torts asserted in the first\namended complaint.\n      As relevant to this appeal, the court instructed the jury that it could\nfind Diblin liable for Gagliardo’s injuries in connection with the gender\nviolence cause of action (Civ. Code, § 52.4) if it found true all of the elements\nof either of two different theories of liability for gender violence. The\ninstruction provided:\n\n\n\n1    Jurors were not instructed as to Gagliardo’s claims for violation of the\nBane Act (Civ. Code, § 52.1) or sexual harassment (Civ. Code, § 51.9), even\nthough those causes of action had been alleged in the first amended\ncomplaint.\n                                        7\n\f         “Monee Gagliardo claims that Curtis Diblin committed an\n         act of gender violence against her. To establish this claim,\n         Monee Gagliardo must prove all of the following:\n\n         “1. Curtis Diblin’s conduct constituted a criminal act under\n         California Law.\n\n         “2. An element of that criminal conduct by Curtis Diblin\n         was the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n         force, and\n\n         “3. The criminal conduct of Curtis Diblin was committed, at\n         least in part, based on the gender of Monee Gagliardo.\n\n         “OR\n\n         “1. Curtis Diblin’s conduct constituted a physical intrusion\n         or invasion upon Monee Gagliardo,\n\n         “2. The physical intrusion upon Monee Gagliardo was\n         sexual in nature, and\n\n         “3. The physical intrusion upon Monee Gagliardo was\n         conducted under coercive conditions.”\n\n      In connection with the intentional tort theories of liability, the court\nalso instructed the jury on the question of Gagliardo’s entitlement to punitive\ndamages. That instruction read:\n         “If you decide that Curtis Diblin’s conduct caused Monee\n         Gagliardo harm, you must decide whether that conduct\n         justified an award of punitive damages. At this time, you\n         must decide whether Monee Gagliardo has proved by clear\n         and convincing evidence that Curtis Diblin engaged in that\n         conduct with malice, oppression, or fraud. The amount of\n         punitive damages, if any, will be decided later.\n\n         “ ‘Malice’ means that Curtis Diblin acted with intent to\n         cause injury or that Curtis Diblin’s conduct was despicable\n         and was done with a willful and knowing disregard of the\n\n                                        8\n\f           rights or safety of another. A person acts with knowing\n           disregard when he or she is aware of the probable\n           dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and\n           deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.\n\n           “ ‘Oppression’ means that Curtis Diblin’s conduct was\n           despicable and subjected Monee Gagliardo to cruel and\n           unjust hardship in knowing disregard of her rights.\n\n           “ ‘Despicable conduct’ is conduct that is so vile, base, or\n           contemptible that it would be looked down on and despised\n           by reasonable people.\n\n           “ ‘Fraud’ means that Curtis Diblin intentionally\n           misrepresented or concealed a material fact and did so\n           intending to harm Monee Gagliardo.”\n\n\n      As also relevant to this appeal, the court instructed the jury on\nGagliardo’s claim for negligence by telling jurors the following:\n           “Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care to prevent\n           harm to oneself or to others. A person can be negligent by\n           acting or by failing to act. A person is negligent if he or she\n           does something that a reasonably careful person would not\n           do in the same situation or fails to do something that a\n           reasonably careful person would do in the same situation.\n           [¶ You must decide how a reasonable careful person would\n           have acted in Curtis Diblin’s situation.”\n\n      3.      The Jury’s Verdicts and Entry of Judgment\n      The jury was asked to make specific findings as to each of the causes of\naction. With respect to each theory of liability that required a finding of\nsexual touching or sexual intent, the jury declined to find Diblin liable.\nHowever, the jury found in Gagliardo’s favor on two theories of liability:\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f(1) that Diblin had committed an act of gender violence against Gagliardo,\n\nand (2) that he had acted negligently, which caused her harm. 2\n      As instructed, the jury was also asked to decide whether Gagliardo was\nentitled to a punitive damage award, but it was not asked to decide what the\namount of any punitive damages should be. In response to the punitive\ndamage questions, the jury found that Diblin “engage[d] in the conduct with\nmalice,” and “engage[d] in the conduct with oppression,” but did not find he\n“engage[d] in the conduct with fraud.”\n      The jury awarded Gagliardo compensatory damages of $2,514,500 for\npast and future economic and noneconomic losses. After the jury verdict was\nread, Gagliardo waived her right to punitive damages.\n      A final judgment was entered in the Gagliardo v. Diblin action on\nFebruary 8, 2018.\n      4.    Postjudgment proceedings in Gagliardo v. Diblin\n      Diblin initially requested that State Farm continue to provide a\ndefense by funding an appeal from the judgment in the underlying action.\nState Farm agreed to fund an appeal. However, Diblin and Gagliardo settled\nthe underlying action. As part of the settlement, Diblin assigned to\nGagliardo his contract and bad faith rights under the Policy.\n      More than four years after final judgment was entered in the\nunderlying proceeding, Gagliardo filed a document titled “Second Amended\nComplaint” in the trial court. The record does not reflect that Gagliardo\nmoved for or received leave of the court to file this document.\n\n\n\n\n2      As previously described, the jury was instructed that to establish a\nclaim for gender violence, Gagliardo would have to prove one or both of two\nsets of elements. The jury found true all three of the first set of elements.\n                                       10\n\f       The document identified as a second amended complaint is in large\npart identical to the first amended complaint. The only major difference\nappears in paragraph 54, which is part of the negligence cause of action. The\nnew version of this paragraph retained the allegation that Diblin “breached\nhis duty of care to Plaintiff by losing self-control and battering and sexually\nassaulting the Plaintiff, as set forth in paragraphs 7-17 herein-above.” But\nparagraph 54 in the new document also included the additional allegation\nthat Diblin “breached the duty of care by being mindful [sic] of the side effects\nof using prescribed testosterone . . . and failing to seek further medical\nassistance” despite “feeling out of sorts mentally and physically.” It further\nadded the allegation that Diblin breached the duty of care by failing to “keep\nadequate distance” from Gagliardo “and/or advising [her] that he was not\nfeeling comfortable in his body . . . all of which was a proximate cause of the\nharm he caused to Plaintiff.” The remainder of the allegations in the second\namended complaint’s negligence cause of action were the same as in the first\namended complaint.\nE.    The Proceedings in This Action\n      Meanwhile, on November 27, 2017—before the Gagliardo v. Diblin\naction was reduced to a final judgment—State Farm filed a complaint for\ndeclaratory relief against Gagliardo and Diblin. State Farm sought\nadjudication of its obligation to pay Gagliardo for any judgment she recovered\nfrom Diblin in the underlying action.\n      Approximately a year later, Gagliardo filed a cross-complaint against\nState Farm for breach of contract and bad faith, and Diblin eventually filed\nhis own cross-complaint, alleging a cause of action for bad faith.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f      The parties stipulated to bifurcate their dispute, with the first phase to\ninvolve a bench trial on State Farm’s declaratory relief cause of action. This\nphase proceeded to trial on November 21, 2022.\n      The trial court admitted in evidence four items: (1) the first amended\ncomplaint in the Gagliardo v. Diblin action; (2) the jury instructions provided\nin that action; (3) the judgment, including the special verdict form; and\n(4) the Policy. The court heard extensive argument from the attorneys.\n      At the conclusion of the parties’ presentations, the trial court\ndetermined that State Farm had “proven its entitlement to a judicial\ndeclaration that it had no duty to indemnify Mr. Diblin for the judgment\nentered in the Underlying Action.” The trial court found that Diblin’s\nliability in the underlying action did not arise from an “occurrence” as is\nrequired for coverage under the Policy, and also found in the alternative that\neven if coverage under the coverage provision were assumed, the Policy’s\nexclusion for damages caused by willful or intentional conduct and/or\nInsurance Code section 533 eliminated the possibility of indemnification for\nthe damages awarded in the underlying action.\n      The trial court entered a final order in favor of State Farm on its\nrequest for declaratory relief, concluding it “owes no coverage for the\njudgment in the Underlying Action.” After Gagliardo and Diblin’s post-trial\nmotions were denied, the court entered judgment in favor of State Farm on\nboth its complaint and the pending cross-complaints.\n                                      III.\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      The parties do not dispute that the judgment in the underlying action\nis preclusive in this coverage action. (See Executive Risk Indemnity, Inc. v.\nJones (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 319, 325, fn. 7 [“ ‘In a new action on a different\n\n\n                                       12\n\fcause of action, a former judgment is conclusive against the parties and\npersons in privity with them on issues litigated in the former action.’ ”].)\nInstead, the parties disagree about the meaning of the special verdict in the\nunderlying action, and they thus disagree as to what, precisely, is to be given\npreclusive effect in this matter. After considering the first amended\ncomplaint, the jury instructions, and the special verdict form, the trial court\nultimately determined the jury’s verdict established that it found Diblin\nacted intentionally when he injured Gagliardo. This determination as to\nwhat the jury found in the underlying matter meant Gagliardo’s injuries\nwere not the result of an “occurrence” (i.e., “an accident”) under the Policy,\nnecessitating a no coverage finding in this matter.\n      Gagliardo and Diblin challenge the trial court’s conclusion that the jury\nin the underlying case found Diblin acted intentionally when he struck\nGagliardo. They first contend the jury’s finding that Diblin was negligent\nnecessitates a finding that the damages awarded in the underlying action are\ncovered under the policy. According to appellants, the jury determined that it\nwas only Diblin’s negligence that caused Gagliardo’s injuries, and therefore,\nbecause an “accident” includes negligence, coverage is mandated. In a\nrelated argument, Diblin argues that the trial court “simply misread the\njury’s verdict” in the underlying action when it concluded that the jury’s\npunitive damages findings meant it had found Diblin acted with intent when\nhe attacked Gagliardo. According to Diblin, because the jury “did not award\npunitive damages,” the jury cannot be understood to have made a finding\nthat would support the conclusion Diblin’s conduct was intentional.\n      Second, appellants contend that even if this court determines the jury\nmade a finding that Diblin’s intentional conduct caused Gagliardo harm, such\na finding should be considered to be an independent concurrent cause of the\n\n\n                                       13\n\fdamages. As this argument goes, under the doctrine of concurrent\nindependent causation, coverage is required based on the jury’s separate\nfinding that he was also negligent.\n      Finally, appellants argue the trial court erred in finding that Insurance\nCode section 533 and/or the express exclusion for willful conduct set out in\nSection II of the Policy applied to exclude coverage for the damages awarded\nin the underlying action. They assert the trial court should have empaneled\na new jury for the specific purpose of determining whether Diblin acted with\na “preconceived design to injure,” which, appellants assert, is necessary to a\nfinding that the risk at issue is excluded by the intentional conduct exclusion\nset out in the Policy or imposed by Insurance Code section 533.\nA. The Trial Court Correctly Determined the Underlying Jury’s Findings in\n   the Special Verdict Form Preclude a Finding of Coverage\n\n      1.    The Meaning of the Policy’s Coverage Clause\n      “An insurance policy is written in two parts: the insuring agreement\ndefines the type of risks which are covered, while the exclusions remove\ncoverage for certain risks which are initially within the insuring clause.”\n(Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co. (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 787, 802–803\n(Collin).) “The insured has the burden of establishing that a claim, unless\nspecifically excluded, is within basic coverage, while the insurer has the\nburden of establishing that a specific exclusion applies.” (Minkler v. Safeco\nIns. Co. of America (2010) 49 Cal.4th 315, 322.)\n      In considering whether there is coverage for a particular risk or\nwhether an exclusion applies to exclude a risk that would otherwise be\ncovered, we must interpret and apply the language of the policy at issue.\n“Insurance policies are contracts and therefore subject to the rules of\nconstruction governing contracts. [Citation.] The goal of contractual\n\n\n                                       14\n\finterpretation is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the\nparties.” (Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 762–763.)\n      Here, the Policy covers claims for damages made “because of bodily\ninjury” that are “caused by an occurrence.” The Policy defines an\n“occurrence” as an “accident.” “[T]he meaning of the term ‘accident’ in a\nliability insurance policy is settled in California. ‘[A]n accident is “ ‘an\nunexpected, unforeseen, or undesigned happening or consequence from either\na known or an unknown cause.’ ” [Citations.] “This common law construction\nof the term ‘accident’ becomes part of the policy and precludes any assertion\nthat the term is ambiguous.” ’ ” (Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. v. Ledesma &\nMeyer Construction Co. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 216, 221 (Liberty Surplus), quoting\nDelgado v. Interinsurance Exchange of Automobile Club of Southern\nCalifornia (2009) 47 Cal.4th 302, 308 (Delgado).)\n      “ ‘[T]he word “accident” in the coverage clause of a liability policy refers\nto the conduct of the insured for which liability is sought to be imposed.’ ”\n(Liberty Surplus, supra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 221.) “When an insured intends the\nacts resulting in the injury or damage, it is not an accident ‘merely because\nthe insured did not intend to cause injury. . . . The insured’s subjective\nintent is irrelevant.’ ” (Albert v. Mid-Century Ins. Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th\n1281, 1291.) “Because the term ‘accident’ refers to the insured’s intent to\ncommit the act giving rise to liability, as opposed to his or her intent to cause\nthe consequences of that act, the courts have recognized—virtually without\nexception—that deliberate conduct is not an ‘accident’ or ‘occurrence’\nirrespective of the insured’s state of mind.” (Collin, supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at\np. 810.)\n      For example, the question in Delgado, supra, 47 Cal.4th at page 311,\nwas whether an insured’s unreasonable, subjective belief in the need for self-\n\n\n                                        15\n\fdefense converts an assault and battery into “ ‘an accident’ ” for purposes of\nan insurance policy that provides coverage for an “occurrence.” Like the\nPolicy here, the policy at issue in Delgado defined an “occurrence” to mean\n“ ‘an accident.’ ” (Id. at pp. 308, 311.) Answering the proposed question in\nthe negative, the Delgado court explained that “an injury-producing event is\nnot an ‘accident’ . . . when all of the acts, the manner in which they were\ndone, and the objective accomplished occurred as intended by the actor.” (Id.\nat pp. 311–312.) Thus, where there had been no allegation that the battering\nacts “were merely shielding or the result of a reflex action,” “the [victim’s]\ninjuries were not as a matter of law accidental.” (Id. at p. 312.)\n      Because the Policy at issue in this case covers only injuries that result\nfrom “accidents,” the relevant question for determining whether Gagliardo’s\ninjuries are covered under the Policy is whether those injuries were the result\nof intentional conduct or whether they instead resulted from an “accident.”\n      2. The Underlying Jury Found Diblin’s Injurious Conduct was\n         Intentional\n\n      The trial court considered the operative pleading, the jury instructions\nand the jury’s special verdict form to conclude that the judgment in the\nunderlying case settled the question whether Gagliardo’s injuries resulted\nfrom intentional conduct, not an accident. On review, we consider the\nquestion of issue preclusion de novo. (See Jenkins v. County of Riverside\n(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 593, 618 [determination as to whether issue\npreclusion applies is a question of law reviewed de novo].)\n      We begin by looking to the special verdict form. As to the specific\ncauses of action the jury was asked to consider, the jury found in favor of\nDiblin and against Gagliardo on Gagliardo’s claims for the following\nintentional torts: sexual assault, sexual battery, and violation of the Ralph\nAct. However, the jury found Diblin liable to Gagliardo on her intentional\n                                        16\n\ftort claim for gender violence (Civ. Code, § 52.4). Because the intentional tort\ncauses of action asserted in the first amended complaint, including the cause\nof action for gender violence, allowed for the imposition of punitive damages,\nthe jury was also asked to determine whether Diblin’s conduct warranted a\npunitive damage award. On the page of the special verdict form titled\n“Punitive Damages,” the jury found that Diblin had engaged in “the conduct”\nboth “with malice” and “with oppression.”\n      Only after the jury answered all of the questions regarding the\nintentional tort theories of liability, was it then asked to make findings as to\nthe only non-intentional tort Gagliardo had asserted—negligence. The jury\nanswered “Yes” that Diblin had been “negligent,” and it then agreed that\nDiblin’s “negligence” was a “substantial factor” in causing Gagliardo’s harm.\n      Finally the jury was asked to determine the amount of economic and\nnoneconomic damages Gagliardo had proven.\n      The jury’s finding that Diblin committed gender violence is a finding\nthat he committed an intentional tort. (See 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law\n(11th ed. 2025) Torts, § 548 [discussing claims for gender violence as a species\nof “Intentional Invasions of Interests in Personality”].) But even aside from\nthe fact that a claim for gender violence sets out a claim for an intentional\ntort, one of the specific elements the jury found true was that Diblin engaged\nin the conduct “at least in part, based on [Gagliardo’s] gender.” In order to\nengage in conduct that is “based on” another person’s gender, the defendant\nnecessarily intended the conduct, negating the possibility that injuries\nresulting from gender violence were attributable to an “accident.”\n      Moreover, even if the jury’s finding on the gender violence claim was\nnot enough itself to make clear that Diblin’s liability for Gagliardo’s injuries\ndoes not come within the Policy’s coverage provision, the jury also found that\n\n\n                                       17\n\fDiblin acted with both malice and oppression in injuring Gagliardo. The\nfinding by the jury that Gagliardo had proven the elements necessary to\nentitle her to a punitive damage award also meant the jury necessarily\nconcluded Diblin’s conduct was deliberate and intentional, as “accidentally\nharmful conduct cannot provide the basis for punitive damages under\n[California] law.” (Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc. (2005) 35\nCal.4th 1159, 1181, italics added.)\n      Diblin nevertheless contends the trial court “simply misread” the jury’s\nverdict when it concluded the jury found Diblin acted intentionally.\nAccording to Diblin, because the jury did not award Gagliardo punitive\ndamages, and instead awarded only “actual damages,” one cannot conclude\nthe jury made a finding that Gagliardo was entitled to punitive damages.\nAlthough it is true the jury did not award Gagliardo punitive damages, the\nlack of an award was not due to the jury rejecting the factual basis for such\nan award. The jury made the factual findings that punitive damages were\nwarranted when it found Diblin acted with malice and oppression. But the\njury was instructed that if it made the underlying factual finding necessary\nto award punitive damages it would be asked to set the amount of punitive\ndamages at a later point in time, and Gagliardo ultimately waived her right\nto have the jury award her punitive damages. The lack of an award of\npunitive damages under these circumstances does not undermine the jury’s\nfactual findings that Diblin acted with malice and with oppression.\n      Appellants further contend that because the jury also made a finding\nDiblin was negligent, the jury must have necessarily concluded Gagliardo’s\ninjuries were caused unintentionally. They argue that only the negligence\nfinding—and not the gender violence finding—should be given preclusive\neffect. Appellants rely on the fact the verdict form expressly asked the jury to\n\n\n                                      18\n\fmake a finding as to causation only with respect to the question of Diblin’s\nnegligence, but not with respect to the gender violence cause of action. This\nsuggestion ignores the jury instructions and the entirety of the verdict form.\nFor example, the jury was told, “You will be asked to decide whether Curtis\nDiblin is liable to Monee Gagliardo under the following legal theories” (italics\nadded), and the instructions listed both “Gender Violence” and “Negligence”\nas two of the six possible legal theories for his liability. The jury was also\ninstructed that it was only to decide whether Diblin’s conduct “justified an\naward of punitive damages” if it “decide[d] that Curtis Diblin’s conduct\ncaused Monee Gagliardo harm.” (Italics added.) Thus, in order to reach the\nquestions about whether Diblin’s conduct was done with malice, oppression\nor fraud, the jury had to first decide that this same conduct caused Gagliardo\nharm. Because the jury reached those punitive damages questions, it had\ndecided that Diblin’s violent conduct caused Gagliardo’s injuries.\n      Nor do we agree with appellants’ suggestion that the jury’s\ndetermination as to negligence is inconsistent with its finding on the gender\nviolence cause of action. When the verdict form is considered as a whole and\nunderstood through the framing of the operative pleading (see Collin, supra,\n21 Cal.App.4th at p. 805 [to determine the nature of the conduct upon which\na judgment is based, one must look to the pleading allegations]), it can be\nunderstood to reflect the jury’s conclusion that Diblin engaged in intentional\nconduct when he attacked Gagliardo, and that this same conduct also met the\nstandard for negligence set out in the jury instructions. The only conduct\nalleged to have caused Gagliardo’s injuries in the first amended complaint\nwas Diblin’s assaultive conduct. Thus, every cause of action asserted by\nGagliardo, including the cause of action for negligence, was based on Diblin’s\nphysical attack—not other conduct. And when the jury was asked to make\n\n\n                                        19\n\ffindings on these causes of action, it was not told that if it found there was\nliability for the attack under an intentional tort theory, the same conduct\ncould not then also support a finding of liability based on negligence. Nor\nwas the jury instructed that it could find Diblin negligent only if it\ndetermined the injury-producing conduct was unintended. Instead, the jury\nwas told that negligence “is the failure to use reasonable care to prevent\nharm to oneself or to others,” and that “[a] person is negligent if he or she\ndoes something that a reasonably careful person would not do in the same\nsituation or fails to do something that a reasonably careful person would do\nin the same situation.” This expressed “failure to use reasonable care”\nstandard is broad enough to include intentionally harmful conduct. In other\nwords, under these instructions, a jury could conclude that a person who\nintentionally injures another person has also failed to use reasonable care to\nprevent injury to another. Thus, in the absence of any instruction telling the\njury that a finding of liability for an intentional tort precludes a finding of\nnegligence based on the same conduct, a determination that the defendant\ncommitted gender violence could also support a negligence finding, i.e., that\nthe defendant did “something that a reasonably careful person would not do\nin the same situation.”\n      There is thus no inconsistency in the jury’s findings that Diblin was\nliable for Gagliardo’s injuries under both an intentional tort theory and a\nnegligence theory. And we have no reason to conclude the jury’s answers to\nthe special verdict questions regarding negligence should be understood to\nreflect a finding that Gagliardo’s injuries were the result of accidental\nconduct. Rather, the verdict form and the jury instructions confirm that the\njury believed Diblin’s injury-producing conduct was deliberate and\nintentional and that this deliberate conduct constituted a breach of the duty\n\n\n                                        20\n\fof care Diblin owed to Gagliardo. We therefore reject appellants’ contention\nthat the jury’s negligence determination in the underlying case mandated a\n\nfinding of coverage in this case. 3\n      3.    The Concurrent Independent Causes Doctrine Does Not Apply\n\n      Relying on State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Partridge (1973) 10 Cal.3d\n94, 97 (Partridge), appellants next argue that a finding of coverage is\ncompelled pursuant to the concurrent independent causes doctrine. Under\nthis doctrine, an insurer has a duty to indemnify an insured if a covered risk\nis a proximate cause of the injury, even if a noncovered risk also jointly\ncaused the injury in question.\n      According to appellants, there is no way to discern “that the conduct of\nDiblin the jury deemed to have been negligent is the same as whatever it\ndeemed to have been malicious, so it is not at all clear the jury perceived\nthere to be a single proximate cause” of Gagliardo’s injuries. Thus,\nappellants suggest, the jury could have concluded that Diblin’s negligent\n\n\n\n3      We also reject Diblin’s references to and reliance on the second\namended complaint to provide any basis for understanding the jury’s verdict\nin the underlying action. Although the superior court’s clerk’s office\npermitted the document to be filed approximately four years after judgment\nwas entered in this case, it is clear this document cannot be given any legal\neffect. A plaintiff may only amend a pleading as a matter of course before an\nanswer or demurrer is filed or before trial of the issue of law raised in the\ndemurrer; after any of these things happens, “the plaintiff’s right to amend as\na matter of course is gone.” (Loser v. E.R. Bacon Co. (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d\n387, 389; see Code Civ. Proc., § 472.) At that point, the pleading can only be\namended by obtaining permission of the court. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 472,\n473.) The record does not demonstrate Gagliardo sought or obtained leave to\nfile the purported second amended complaint in the underlying action when\nshe submitted it for filing. Absent the court granting Gagliardo permission to\namend the first amended complaint, the purported second amended\ncomplaint has no effect.\n                                       21\n\fconduct was different from the conduct that the jury found to be malicious.\nAnd, their argument goes, even if the special verdict is interpreted as\nexpressing that the jury found Diblin liable for an intentional tort (the gender\nviolence cause of action), which is a noncovered cause of the injuries, the jury\nmust have also found Diblin liable for different conduct amounting to\nnegligence, which is a covered cause of the injuries.\n      In appellants’ view, the evidence presented in the underlying trial not\nonly supported a theory of liability based on gender violence, but also\nsupported theories of liability related to Diblin’s “negligent management of\nhis own medical condition” or his negligent failure to warn Gagliardo that he\nwas feeling out of sorts and aggressive that morning. They argue that\nnegligence based on Diblin’s failure to manage the effects of his testosterone\nmedication or his failure to warn Gagliardo about those effects would be a\ncovered risk under the Policy. According to appellants, the jury may have\nfound him liable for these other types of conduct when the jury determined\nhis negligence caused Gagliardo’s injuries. However, Partridge and the law\nof concurrent independent causation does not assist appellants.\n      In Partridge, the insured was traveling in his car with a hunting gun\nhe had modified to create a “hair trigger” action. After the insured drove the\ncar off road, the car hit a bump and the gun fired, hitting and paralyzing a\npassenger, who sued. (Partridge, supra, 10 Cal.3d at pp. 97–98.) The\ninsured’s homeowner’s liability policy covered liability resulting from the gun\nmodification, but it did not cover injuries arising out of the use of a motor\nvehicle. (Id. at pp. 102–103.) The Partridge court concluded that the fact\nthat the gun accidently fired in a car did not preclude coverage. (Ibid.)\nRather, where two independent risks jointly caused the injury, the insurer is\nliable so long as one of the risks is covered by the policy. (Id. at pp. 102–103.)\n\n\n                                       22\n\fThe Partridge court explained that “although the accident occurred in a\nvehicle, the insured’s negligent modification of the gun suffices, in itself, to\nrender him fully liable for the resulting injuries. . . . [I]nasmuch as the\nliability of the insured arises from his non-auto-related conduct, and exists\nindependently of any ‘use’ of his car, we believe the homeowner’s policy covers\nthat liability.” (Id. at p. 103.)\n      Concurrent independent causes “are multiple forces operating at the\nsame time and independently, each of which would have been sufficient by\nitself to bring about the harm.” (Viner v. Sweet (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1232, 1240,\nitalics added.) Therefore, “[c]ourts following Partridge have made it clear\nthat its holding applies to ‘multiple causes that operated totally\nindependently of one another.’ ” (Medill v. Westport Ins. Corp. (2006) 143\nCal.App.4th 819, 835, citing State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Kohl (1982) 131\nCal.App.3d 1031, 1039 and Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Purdie (1983) 145\nCal.App.3d 57, 68.)\n      Thus, for example, in Safeco Ins. Co. v. Gilstrap (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d\n524, 530 (Safeco), the court distinguished Partridge on the ground the\nasserted concurrent causes were not independent of one another. The two\nasserted concurrent negligent acts at issue were the insured parents’\nnegligent entrustment of a motorcycle to their 14-year-old son, and the son’s\nnegligence in operating the motorcycle when he collided with another\nmotorcycle and injured a third party. (Id. at pp. 526, 527.) As the Safeco\ncourt explained, “[t]he separate and independent act in Partridge giving rise\nto liability was a ‘non-auto-related act,’ i.e., the filing of the gun trigger[, and\nt]hat act had nothing to do with the use or operation of a vehicle.” (Id. at\np. 527.) “In contrast to Partridge, the obligation of the insureds” in Safeco\n“did not arise from an act separate and independent from the use of the\n\n\n                                         23\n\fvehicle itself,” as the parents’ conduct in negligently entrusting the vehicle to\ntheir minor son could not “be disassociated from the use of the vehicle itself.”\n(Id. at pp. 527–528.) Ultimately the Safeco court determined the asserted\ncovered risk was not a concurrent independent cause of the third party’s\ninjury, as “the injury here involved no instrumentality other than the vehicle\nitself and . . . there would have been no accident without the use or operation\nof the motorcycle.” (Id. at pp. 530–531.)\n      And similarly in Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2013) 220\nCal.App.4th 1199 (Farmers), the court explained why the Partridge rule did\nnot mandate coverage. The underlying claim in Farmers arose from the\naccident in which a grandfather ran over his granddaughter with his pickup\ntruck. (Id. at pp. 1204–1212.) There, the court considered whether the\ngrandfather’s negligent operation of his truck and the grandmother’s\nnegligent supervision of a child were independent concurrent causes of the\nchild’s fatal injuries. (Id. at p. 1208.) The Farmers court determined the\ncauses were not independent, and the homeowner’s policy exclusion for\ninjuries arising from use of a motor vehicle therefore applied. It explained\nthat in similar cases finding coverage barred, the excluded instrumentality\n“played an active role in causing the injury,” and the injury “ ‘involved no\ninstrumentality other than the [excluded instrumentality the] vehicle itself,’\nand ‘there would have been no accident without the use or operation of’ the\nvehicle.” (Id. at p. 1209, quoting Safeco, supra, 141 Cal.App.3d at p. 530.)\nThe court found the grandmother’s “negligent supervision was not ‘separate\nand independent’ of [the grandfather’s] negligent automobile use because\nthere was only one way, one place, and one time [the grandmother’s]\nnegligence could give rise to liability: when [the grandfather] arrived home in\nhis truck.” (Farmers, at p. 1212.)\n\n\n                                       24\n\f      Applying Partridge and subsequent cases considering its rule, we must\nreject appellants’ contention regarding the applicability of the concurrent\nindependent causes doctrine. As a preliminary matter, as we have already\nexplained, we are unconvinced the jury’s verdict reflects that it was holding\nDiblin liable for two separate types of conduct when it found that Diblin\ncommitted gender violence and that he acted negligently. Again, the jury\nwas not told that finding specific damage-producing conduct was intentional\nwould preclude them from also finding that the same conduct was negligent.\nAbsent an instruction that a finding of liability on any of the intentional tort\ntheories would prevent a finding of negligence based on the same asserted\nconduct, one cannot presume that the jury relied on two different sets of\nconduct in finding that Diblin was liable for an intentional tort and for his\nnegligence.\n      But even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that appellants\nwere correct that the jury’s verdict could be interpreted as reflecting that the\njury found Diblin liable to Gagliardo based on two separate acts or omissions\n(one being his intentionally violent conduct and the other being his\nmismanagement of his medication and/or his failure to warn Gagliardo about\nthe side effects he was experiencing), the concurrent independent causes rule\ndoes not apply because the purported noncovered and covered causes of the\ninjury are not independent of each other. Appellants’ argument is that the\njury could have found Diblin liable on the gender violence cause of action\nbased on his conduct of deliberately striking Gagliardo with a mallet, and\nthat it also could have found him liable for negligence based on his failure to\nwarn Gagliardo or his failure to seek additional medical care to reduce the\nside effects of the testosterone. But unlike in Partridge, where the negligent\nfiling of the gun’s trigger mechanism and the negligent driving each could\n\n\n                                       25\n\fhave separately resulted in injury (see Partridge, supra, 10 Cal.3d at p. 103),\nthe failure to address the side effects of the testosterone or to warn Gagliardo\nabout his experience of the violent side effects were not risks that themselves\ncould have caused Gagliardo harm. It is only when these omissions are\ncoupled with Diblin’s violent conduct that any injury could have possibly\nresulted. In fact, Diblin’s theory of the role of his purported negligence\nregarding the side effects of the testosterone demonstrates the\ninterdependency of these two purported concurrent causes. Under Diblin’s\ntheory of what occurred, his aggression was a side effect of the testosterone\ntreatment, and it was this medication-induced aggression that led to his\nviolent conduct—conduct the underlying jury found constituted the\nintentional tort of gender violence. Thus, possible testosterone-related\nnegligence was “integrally connected to” (Prince v. United National Ins. Co.\n(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 233, 245) Diblin’s intentional violent conduct, not\nindependent of it. Consequently, the concurrent independent causes rule set\nout in Partridge does not apply to mandate coverage, even assuming the jury\nin the underlying case found that Diblin was liable for Gagliardo’s injuries\nbased on the separate types of purportedly negligent conduct appellants’\nidentify on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       26\n\f   4. There Is No Need for a New Jury to Decide Whether Diblin Acted with a\n      “Preconceived Design to Injure”\n\n       In their final argument, appellants contend the trial court should not\n\nhave decided that Insurance Code section 533 4 and/or the express exclusion\nfor willful conduct set out in Section II of the Policy apply to exclude coverage\nfor the damages awarded in the underlying action. For example, appellants\nrely on Walters v. American Insurance Co. (1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 776 and\nMeyer v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co. (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 321, among others,\nto assert the trial court should have empaneled a new jury for the specific\npurpose of determining whether Diblin acted with a “preconceived design to\ninjure.” According to appellants, these authorities require a jury to find that\nDiblin acted with a “preconceived design to injure” before the particular risk\nfrom that conduct can be excluded from coverage under the Policy’s willful\nconduct exclusion or the similar exclusion implied by Insurance Code section\n533.\n       Even assuming the cited authorities remain valid and that they require\na finding that Diblin acted with “preconceived design to injure” before a\nwillful acts exclusion may prevent coverage, there is no need for a jury to\nmake such a determination in this case. If a claim is not covered under a\npolicy’s coverage provisions, then there is no need to consider whether the\nclaim would be excluded under an exclusion provision. (See Rosen v. Nations\nTitle Ins. Co. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1497.) As we have already\n\n\n\n4     Insurance Code section 533 provides, “An insurer is not liable for a loss\ncaused by the willful act of the insured; but he is not exonerated by the\nnegligence of the insured, or of the insured’s agents or others.” This provision\noperates as “ ‘an implied exclusionary clause which by statute is to be read\ninto all insurance policies.’ ” (J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M. K. (1991) 52\nCal.3d 1009, 1019.)\n                                       27\n\fdetermined, the jury’s verdict in the underlying case establishes that\nGagliardo’s injuries were not the result of an “occurrence” under the Policy’s\ncoverage provision. Because the claim does not come within the coverage\nprovision, there is no need to consider the express exclusion provision in\nSection II of the Policy or the exclusion implied in every policy by Insurance\nCode section 533. Thus, the trial court made no error in declining to empanel\na new jury to determine whether Diblin acted with a “preconceived design to\ninjure.”\n                                        IV.\n                                  DISPOSITION\n         The judgment of the trial court is affirmed. Respondent shall recover\ncosts.\n\n\n                                                            MCCONNELL, P.

State Farm issued Diblin a\nhomeowners policy that covered injuries arising from an “occurrence,” which\nthe policy defined as “an accident.” While the policy was in effect, Diblin\nattacked Gagliardo, who was one of his housemates, by striking her over the\nhead with a mallet multiple times. Gagliardo sued Diblin to recover\neconomic and noneconomic damages. A jury found in her favor on two\ntheories of liability and awarded her more than $2.5 million dollars in\ncompensatory damages.\n      Before the jury’s verdict in the underlying action was reduced to a\njudgment, State Farm filed this declaratory relief action against Gagliardo\nand Diblin. State Farm sought a determination that it owed no duty to\nindemnify Diblin for the amount of Gagliardo’s judgment. After reviewing\nthe pleadings, the jury instructions, and the special verdict form, the trial\ncourt determined the findings of the jury in the underlying action\nconclusively established that Diblin’s injury-producing conduct was not the\nresult of an “accident,” and Gagliardo’s damages therefore did not arise from\na covered “occurrence” under the policy. The court entered judgment in favor\nof State Farm on its complaint for declaratory relief.\n      On appeal, Diblin and Gagliardo contend the trial court erred in\ninterpreting the findings of the jury in the underlying action and in\nconcluding the underlying damage award is not covered by Diblin’s policy.\nWe affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f                                       II.\n                                BACKGROUND\nA.    The Injury-Producing Event and Diblin’s Criminal Prosecution\n      In May 2015, Diblin and Gagliardo were housemates and friends. On\nthe morning of May 23, 2015, Gagliardo visited Diblin in his bedroom to use\nhis coffee machine and computer, as she had done on other occasions.\nGagliardo sat in a chair to check her e-mail while Diblin stood behind her.\n“All of a sudden,” Gagliardo felt something that made her think “the ceiling\nfell down on [her] head.” After a moment, she realized Diblin was beating\nher over the head with a rubber mallet. Diblin struck her multiple times.\n      Police arrested Diblin, and he was criminally prosecuted. He\nultimately pled guilty to one count of assault with intent to commit a sexual\ncrime and admitted great bodily injury and dangerous weapon\nenhancements.\nB.    The Pleadings in the Underlying Action\n      On November 6, 2015, Gagliardo filed a civil action against Diblin in\nGagliardo v. Diblin, San Diego Superior Court case No. 37-2015-00037520\n(Gagliardo v. Diblin or the underlying action). In her first amended\ncomplaint, Gagliardo asserted causes of action for sexual assault, sexual\nbattery, gender violence (Civ. Code, § 52.4), violation of the Ralph Civil\nRights Act of 1976 (Civ. Code, § 51.7; the Ralph Act), violation of the Tom\nBane Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, § 52.1; the Bane Act), sexual harassment,\nand negligence. Each of the first amended complaint’s seven causes of action,\nincluding the claim for negligence, asserted entitlement to relief based on the\nsame asserted conduct–Diblin’s attack on Gagliardo.\n      For example, as to the negligence cause of action, the first amended\ncomplaint alleged Diblin “breached [the] duty of care” he owed to Gagliardo\n\n\n                                        3\n\f“by battering and sexually assaulting” her, as set out in other paragraphs in\nthe pleading. In those referenced paragraphs, Gagliardo alleged Diblin,\n“came up behind her, without provocation, and began bludgeoning her in the\nback of the head with a hardened rubber mallet” approximately “three [to]\nfive times.” Gagliardo further alleged Diblin “dragged” her “from the chair\nand threw [her] on the floor,” after which he “punched her in the head with a\nclosed fist.” According to the allegations, Diblin also “removed [Gagliardo’s]\nrobe and groped her right breast,” and then “kissed [her] left cheek.”\nGagliardo additionally alleged that when she attempted to get away, he\n“grabbed [her] in a wrestling hold and laid on top of her on the bed.”\n      Gagliardo alleged she suffered a variety of physical and emotional\ninjuries “due to the sexual harassment, battery, and assault she suffered at\nthe hands of Diblin” (some capitalization omitted). In addition, she alleged\nDiblin’s “aforementioned conduct” “was done with malice and intent to\ninjure,” such that she was entitled to punitive damages.\n      The first amended complaint alleged no other factual or legal basis for\nthe negligence cause of action. The complaint made no mention of Diblin’s\nuse of prescription testosterone, nor did it assert a breach of due care\ninvolving the failure to monitor or warn of the side effects related to the\ntestosterone medication Diblin was prescribed.\n      The operative pleading at the time the jury rendered its verdict and\njudgment was entered was the first amended complaint.\nC.    The Policy\n\n      Diblin tendered the underlying action to State Farm under\nHomeowners Policy No. 03-BZ-A489-7 (the Policy).\n      The Policy provided Diblin liability coverage under the following\nlanguage:\n\n                                        4\n\f   “SECTION II – LIABILITY COVERAGES\n\n   “COVERAGE L - PERSONAL LIABILITY\n\n   “If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured\n   for damages because of bodily injury or property damage to\n   which this coverage applies, caused by an occurrence, we\n   will:\n\n   “1. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which\n   the insured is legally liable; and\n\n   “2. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our\n   choice. We may make any investigation and settle any\n   claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our obligation\n   to defend any claim or suit ends when the amount we pay\n   for damages, to effect settlement or satisfy a judgment\n   resulting from the occurrence, equals our limit of liability.\n\nThe Policy defined an “occurrence” as follows:\n   “FE-3419\n   DEFINITIONS\n\n   “Definitions 6. and 7. are replaced by the following:\n\n   “[¶] . . . [¶]\n\n   “7. ‘occurrence’, when used in Section II of this policy,\n   means an accident, including exposure to conditions, which\n   first results in:\n\n   “a. bodily injury; or\n\n   “b. property damage;\n\n   “during the policy period. All bodily injury and property\n   damage resulting from one accident, series of related\n   accidents or from continuous and repeated exposure to the\n   same general conditions is considered to be one occurrence.”\n   (Italics added.)\n\n                                 5\n\f      In Section II, the Policy also included an exclusion for damages caused\nby willful or intentional conduct:\n           “SECTION II – EXCLUSIONS\n\n           “1. Coverage L and Coverage M do not apply to:\n\n           “a. bodily injury or property damage:\n\n           “(1) which is either expected or intended by the insured; or\n\n           “(2) which is the result of willful and malicious acts of the\n           insured.”\n\n      State Farm accepted Diblin’s tender and agreed to provide a defense,\nsubject to a reservation of rights.\nD.    The Trial and Outcome in Gagliardo v. Diblin\n      1.      The Evidence\n      The Gagliardo v. Diblin action proceeded to trial in January 2018.\nGagliardo testified about the attack consistent with the allegations of the\nfirst amended complaint. As she testified, the attack was “a sadomasochistic\nbeating” and “an attempted rape.”\n      Diblin’s videotaped deposition was introduced at trial. He described his\nview of what happened the morning of the attack and admitted that he had\nused a mallet to hit Gagliardo on the head three times in quick succession.\nDiblin denied all of Gagliardo’s allegations that the attack involved sexual\ntouching or that he had made sexual comments or engaged in other behavior\nthat could have been interpreted as sexual in nature, such as trying to take\noff his own shorts. He indicated he pled guilty to the charge of assault with\nintent to commit a sexual offense because he was facing multiple serious\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fcharges, and he admitted to an offense that would result in a lesser sentence\nthan if he were to be found guilty of the charged counts.\n      Diblin also called Dr. Alan Abrams, a forensic psychiatrist, to support\nhis defense. Dr. Abrams acknowledged that Diblin admitted having hit\nGagliardo. Dr. Abrams opined that Diblin’s violent behavior that morning\nwas due to a “hypomanic episode attributable to the external testosterone”\nDiblin was taking as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. It was his\nview that Diblin “flew” into rage due to his testosterone-induced “irritable,\nagitated, hypomanic state.”\n      2.    The Jury Instructions\n      The court instructed the jury in connection with each of six theories of\nliability that corresponded with five of the causes of action asserted in first\namended complaint: sexual assault, sexual battery, gender violence, violation\nof the Ralph Act based on threats of violence, violation of the Ralph Act based\n\non acts of violence, and negligence. 1 The jury was not asked to decide\nwhether Diblin committed a battery or other intentional tort beyond the\nsexual and/or gender violence based intentional torts asserted in the first\namended complaint.\n      As relevant to this appeal, the court instructed the jury that it could\nfind Diblin liable for Gagliardo’s injuries in connection with the gender\nviolence cause of action (Civ. Code, § 52.4) if it found true all of the elements\nof either of two different theories of liability for gender violence. The\ninstruction provided:\n\n\n\n1    Jurors were not instructed as to Gagliardo’s claims for violation of the\nBane Act (Civ. Code, § 52.1) or sexual harassment (Civ. Code, § 51.9), even\nthough those causes of action had been alleged in the first amended\ncomplaint.\n                                        7\n\f         “Monee Gagliardo claims that Curtis Diblin committed an\n         act of gender violence against her. To establish this claim,\n         Monee Gagliardo must prove all of the following:\n\n         “1. Curtis Diblin’s conduct constituted a criminal act under\n         California Law.\n\n         “2. An element of that criminal conduct by Curtis Diblin\n         was the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n         force, and\n\n         “3. The criminal conduct of Curtis Diblin was committed, at\n         least in part, based on the gender of Monee Gagliardo.\n\n         “OR\n\n         “1. Curtis Diblin’s conduct constituted a physical intrusion\n         or invasion upon Monee Gagliardo,\n\n         “2. The physical intrusion upon Monee Gagliardo was\n         sexual in nature, and\n\n         “3. The physical intrusion upon Monee Gagliardo was\n         conducted under coercive conditions.”\n\n      In connection with the intentional tort theories of liability, the court\nalso instructed the jury on the question of Gagliardo’s entitlement to punitive\ndamages. That instruction read:\n         “If you decide that Curtis Diblin’s conduct caused Monee\n         Gagliardo harm, you must decide whether that conduct\n         justified an award of punitive damages. At this time, you\n         must decide whether Monee Gagliardo has proved by clear\n         and convincing evidence that Curtis Diblin engaged in that\n         conduct with malice, oppression, or fraud. The amount of\n         punitive damages, if any, will be decided later.\n\n         “ ‘Malice’ means that Curtis Diblin acted with intent to\n         cause injury or that Curtis Diblin’s conduct was despicable\n         and was done with a willful and knowing disregard of the\n\n                                        8\n\f           rights or safety of another. A person acts with knowing\n           disregard when he or she is aware of the probable\n           dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and\n           deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.\n\n           “ ‘Oppression’ means that Curtis Diblin’s conduct was\n           despicable and subjected Monee Gagliardo to cruel and\n           unjust hardship in knowing disregard of her rights.\n\n           “ ‘Despicable conduct’ is conduct that is so vile, base, or\n           contemptible that it would be looked down on and despised\n           by reasonable people.\n\n           “ ‘Fraud’ means that Curtis Diblin intentionally\n           misrepresented or concealed a material fact and did so\n           intending to harm Monee Gagliardo.”\n\n\n      As also relevant to this appeal, the court instructed the jury on\nGagliardo’s claim for negligence by telling jurors the following:\n           “Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care to prevent\n           harm to oneself or to others. A person can be negligent by\n           acting or by failing to act. A person is negligent if he or she\n           does something that a reasonably careful person would not\n           do in the same situation or fails to do something that a\n           reasonably careful person would do in the same situation.\n           [¶ You must decide how a reasonable careful person would\n           have acted in Curtis Diblin’s situation.”\n\n      3.      The Jury’s Verdicts and Entry of Judgment\n      The jury was asked to make specific findings as to each of the causes of\naction. With respect to each theory of liability that required a finding of\nsexual touching or sexual intent, the jury declined to find Diblin liable.\nHowever, the jury found in Gagliardo’s favor on two theories of liability:\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f(1) that Diblin had committed an act of gender violence against Gagliardo,\n\nand (2) that he had acted negligently, which caused her harm. 2\n      As instructed, the jury was also asked to decide whether Gagliardo was\nentitled to a punitive damage award, but it was not asked to decide what the\namount of any punitive damages should be. In response to the punitive\ndamage questions, the jury found that Diblin “engage[d] in the conduct with\nmalice,” and “engage[d] in the conduct with oppression,” but did not find he\n“engage[d] in the conduct with fraud.”\n      The jury awarded Gagliardo compensatory damages of $2,514,500 for\npast and future economic and noneconomic losses. After the jury verdict was\nread, Gagliardo waived her right to punitive damages.\n      A final judgment was entered in the Gagliardo v. Diblin action on\nFebruary 8, 2018.\n      4.    Postjudgment proceedings in Gagliardo v. Diblin\n      Diblin initially requested that State Farm continue to provide a\ndefense by funding an appeal from the judgment in the underlying action.\nState Farm agreed to fund an appeal. However, Diblin and Gagliardo settled\nthe underlying action. As part of the settlement, Diblin assigned to\nGagliardo his contract and bad faith rights under the Policy.\n      More than four years after final judgment was entered in the\nunderlying proceeding, Gagliardo filed a document titled “Second Amended\nComplaint” in the trial court. The record does not reflect that Gagliardo\nmoved for or received leave of the court to file this document.\n\n\n\n\n2      As previously described, the jury was instructed that to establish a\nclaim for gender violence, Gagliardo would have to prove one or both of two\nsets of elements. The jury found true all three of the first set of elements.\n                                       10\n\f       The document identified as a second amended complaint is in large\npart identical to the first amended complaint. The only major difference\nappears in paragraph 54, which is part of the negligence cause of action. The\nnew version of this paragraph retained the allegation that Diblin “breached\nhis duty of care to Plaintiff by losing self-control and battering and sexually\nassaulting the Plaintiff, as set forth in paragraphs 7-17 herein-above.” But\nparagraph 54 in the new document also included the additional allegation\nthat Diblin “breached the duty of care by being mindful [sic] of the side effects\nof using prescribed testosterone . . . and failing to seek further medical\nassistance” despite “feeling out of sorts mentally and physically.” It further\nadded the allegation that Diblin breached the duty of care by failing to “keep\nadequate distance” from Gagliardo “and/or advising [her] that he was not\nfeeling comfortable in his body . . . all of which was a proximate cause of the\nharm he caused to Plaintiff.” The remainder of the allegations in the second\namended complaint’s negligence cause of action were the same as in the first\namended complaint.\nE.    The Proceedings in This Action\n      Meanwhile, on November 27, 2017—before the Gagliardo v. Diblin\naction was reduced to a final judgment—State Farm filed a complaint for\ndeclaratory relief against Gagliardo and Diblin. State Farm sought\nadjudication of its obligation to pay Gagliardo for any judgment she recovered\nfrom Diblin in the underlying action.\n      Approximately a year later, Gagliardo filed a cross-complaint against\nState Farm for breach of contract and bad faith, and Diblin eventually filed\nhis own cross-complaint, alleging a cause of action for bad faith.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f      The parties stipulated to bifurcate their dispute, with the first phase to\ninvolve a bench trial on State Farm’s declaratory relief cause of action. This\nphase proceeded to trial on November 21, 2022.\n      The trial court admitted in evidence four items: (1) the first amended\ncomplaint in the Gagliardo v. Diblin action; (2) the jury instructions provided\nin that action; (3) the judgment, including the special verdict form; and\n(4) the Policy. The court heard extensive argument from the attorneys.\n      At the conclusion of the parties’ presentations, the trial court\ndetermined that State Farm had “proven its entitlement to a judicial\ndeclaration that it had no duty to indemnify Mr. Diblin for the judgment\nentered in the Underlying Action.” The trial court found that Diblin’s\nliability in the underlying action did not arise from an “occurrence” as is\nrequired for coverage under the Policy, and also found in the alternative that\neven if coverage under the coverage provision were assumed, the Policy’s\nexclusion for damages caused by willful or intentional conduct and/or\nInsurance Code section 533 eliminated the possibility of indemnification for\nthe damages awarded in the underlying action.\n      The trial court entered a final order in favor of State Farm on its\nrequest for declaratory relief, concluding it “owes no coverage for the\njudgment in the Underlying Action.” After Gagliardo and Diblin’s post-trial\nmotions were denied, the court entered judgment in favor of State Farm on\nboth its complaint and the pending cross-complaints.\n                                      III.\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      The parties do not dispute that the judgment in the underlying action\nis preclusive in this coverage action.

After considering the first amended\ncomplaint, the jury instructions, and the special verdict form, the trial court\nultimately determined the jury’s verdict established that it found Diblin\nacted intentionally when he injured Gagliardo. This determination as to\nwhat the jury found in the underlying matter meant Gagliardo’s injuries\nwere not the result of an “occurrence” (i.e., “an accident”) under the Policy,\nnecessitating a no coverage finding in this matter.\n      Gagliardo and Diblin challenge the trial court’s conclusion that the jury\nin the underlying case found Diblin acted intentionally when he struck\nGagliardo. They first contend the jury’s finding that Diblin was negligent\nnecessitates a finding that the damages awarded in the underlying action are\ncovered under the policy. According to appellants, the jury determined that it\nwas only Diblin’s negligence that caused Gagliardo’s injuries, and therefore,\nbecause an “accident” includes negligence, coverage is mandated. In a\nrelated argument, Diblin argues that the trial court “simply misread the\njury’s verdict” in the underlying action when it concluded that the jury’s\npunitive damages findings meant it had found Diblin acted with intent when\nhe attacked Gagliardo. According to Diblin, because the jury “did not award\npunitive damages,” the jury cannot be understood to have made a finding\nthat would support the conclusion Diblin’s conduct was intentional.\n      Second, appellants contend that even if this court determines the jury\nmade a finding that Diblin’s intentional conduct caused Gagliardo harm, such\na finding should be considered to be an independent concurrent cause of the\n\n\n                                       13\n\fdamages. As this argument goes, under the doctrine of concurrent\nindependent causation, coverage is required based on the jury’s separate\nfinding that he was also negligent.\n      Finally, appellants argue the trial court erred in finding that Insurance\nCode section 533 and/or the express exclusion for willful conduct set out in\nSection II of the Policy applied to exclude coverage for the damages awarded\nin the underlying action. They assert the trial court should have empaneled\na new jury for the specific purpose of determining whether Diblin acted with\na “preconceived design to injure,” which, appellants assert, is necessary to a\nfinding that the risk at issue is excluded by the intentional conduct exclusion\nset out in the Policy or imposed by Insurance Code section 533.\nA.

Answering the proposed question in\nthe negative, the Delgado court explained that “an injury-producing event is\nnot an ‘accident’ . . . when all of the acts, the manner in which they were\ndone, and the objective accomplished occurred as intended by the actor.” (Id.\nat pp. 311–312.) Thus, where there had been no allegation that the battering\nacts “were merely shielding or the result of a reflex action,” “the [victim’s]\ninjuries were not as a matter of law accidental.” (Id. at p. 312.)\n      Because the Policy at issue in this case covers only injuries that result\nfrom “accidents,” the relevant question for determining whether Gagliardo’s\ninjuries are covered under the Policy is whether those injuries were the result\nof intentional conduct or whether they instead resulted from an “accident.”\n      2. The Underlying Jury Found Diblin’s Injurious Conduct was\n         Intentional\n\n      The trial court considered the operative pleading, the jury instructions\nand the jury’s special verdict form to conclude that the judgment in the\nunderlying case settled the question whether Gagliardo’s injuries resulted\nfrom intentional conduct, not an accident. On review, we consider the\nquestion of issue preclusion de novo. (See Jenkins v. County of Riverside\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2253685\"><a href=\"/opinion/2253685/jenkins-v-county-of-riverside/#618\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Jenkins v. County of Riverside\">138 Cal.App.4th 593, 618</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [determination as to whether issue\npreclusion applies is a question of law reviewed de novo].)\n      We begin by looking to the special verdict form. As to the specific\ncauses of action the jury was asked to consider, the jury found in favor of\nDiblin and against Gagliardo on Gagliardo’s claims for the following\nintentional torts: sexual assault, sexual battery, and violation of the Ralph\nAct. However, the jury found Diblin liable to Gagliardo on her intentional\n                                        16\n\ftort claim for gender violence (Civ. Code, § 52.4). Because the intentional tort\ncauses of action asserted in the first amended complaint, including the cause\nof action for gender violence, allowed for the imposition of punitive damages,\nthe jury was also asked to determine whether Diblin’s conduct warranted a\npunitive damage award. On the page of the special verdict form titled\n“Punitive Damages,” the jury found that Diblin had engaged in “the conduct”\nboth “with malice” and “with oppression.”\n      Only after the jury answered all of the questions regarding the\nintentional tort theories of liability, was it then asked to make findings as to\nthe only non-intentional tort Gagliardo had asserted—negligence. The jury\nanswered “Yes” that Diblin had been “negligent,” and it then agreed that\nDiblin’s “negligence” was a “substantial factor” in causing Gagliardo’s harm.\n      Finally the jury was asked to determine the amount of economic and\nnoneconomic damages Gagliardo had proven.\n      The jury’s finding that Diblin committed gender violence is a finding\nthat he committed an intentional tort. (See 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law\n(11th ed. 2025) Torts, § 548 [discussing claims for gender violence as a species\nof “Intentional Invasions of Interests in Personality”].) But even aside from\nthe fact that a claim for gender violence sets out a claim for an intentional\ntort, one of the specific elements the jury found true was that Diblin engaged\nin the conduct “at least in part, based on [Gagliardo’s] gender.” In order to\nengage in conduct that is “based on” another person’s gender, the defendant\nnecessarily intended the conduct, negating the possibility that injuries\nresulting from gender violence were attributable to an “accident.”\n      Moreover, even if the jury’s finding on the gender violence claim was\nnot enough itself to make clear that Diblin’s liability for Gagliardo’s injuries\ndoes not come within the Policy’s coverage provision, the jury also found that\n\n\n                                       17\n\fDiblin acted with both malice and oppression in injuring Gagliardo. The\nfinding by the jury that Gagliardo had proven the elements necessary to\nentitle her to a punitive damage award also meant the jury necessarily\nconcluded Diblin’s conduct was deliberate and intentional, as “accidentally\nharmful conduct cannot provide the basis for punitive damages under\n[California] law.” (Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc. (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570318\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570318/simon-v-san-paolo-us-holding-co-inc/#1181\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Simon v. San Paolo US Holding Co., Inc.\">35\nCal.4th 1159, 1181</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, italics added.)\n      Diblin nevertheless contends the trial court “simply misread” the jury’s\nverdict when it concluded the jury found Diblin acted intentionally.\nAccording to Diblin, because the jury did not award Gagliardo punitive\ndamages, and instead awarded only “actual damages,” one cannot conclude\nthe jury made a finding that Gagliardo was entitled to punitive damages.\nAlthough it is true the jury did not award Gagliardo punitive damages, the\nlack of an award was not due to the jury rejecting the factual basis for such\nan award. The jury made the factual findings that punitive damages were\nwarranted when it found Diblin acted with malice and oppression. But the\njury was instructed that if it made the underlying factual finding necessary\nto award punitive damages it would be asked to set the amount of punitive\ndamages at a later point in time, and Gagliardo ultimately waived her right\nto have the jury award her punitive damages. The lack of an award of\npunitive damages under these circumstances does not undermine the jury’s\nfactual findings that Diblin acted with malice and with oppression.\n      Appellants further contend that because the jury also made a finding\nDiblin was negligent, the jury must have necessarily concluded Gagliardo’s\ninjuries were caused unintentionally. They argue that only the negligence\nfinding—and not the gender violence finding—should be given preclusive\neffect. Appellants rely on the fact the verdict form expressly asked the jury to\n\n\n                                      18\n\fmake a finding as to causation only with respect to the question of Diblin’s\nnegligence, but not with respect to the gender violence cause of action. This\nsuggestion ignores the jury instructions and the entirety of the verdict form.\nFor example, the jury was told, “You will be asked to decide whether Curtis\nDiblin is liable to Monee Gagliardo under the following legal theories” (italics\nadded), and the instructions listed both “Gender Violence” and “Negligence”\nas two of the six possible legal theories for his liability. The jury was also\ninstructed that it was only to decide whether Diblin’s conduct “justified an\naward of punitive damages” if it “decide[d] that Curtis Diblin’s conduct\ncaused Monee Gagliardo harm.” (Italics added.) Thus, in order to reach the\nquestions about whether Diblin’s conduct was done with malice, oppression\nor fraud, the jury had to first decide that this same conduct caused Gagliardo\nharm. Because the jury reached those punitive damages questions, it had\ndecided that Diblin’s violent conduct caused Gagliardo’s injuries.\n      Nor do we agree with appellants’ suggestion that the jury’s\ndetermination as to negligence is inconsistent with its finding on the gender\nviolence cause of action. When the verdict form is considered as a whole and\nunderstood through the framing of the operative pleading (see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9748982\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279329/collin-v-american-empire-insurance/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Collin v. American Empire Insurance\">Collin, supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9748982\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279329/collin-v-american-empire-insurance/#805\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Collin v. American Empire Insurance\">21 Cal.App.4th at p. 805</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [to determine the nature of the conduct upon which\na judgment is based, one must look to the pleading allegations]), it can be\nunderstood to reflect the jury’s conclusion that Diblin engaged in intentional\nconduct when he attacked Gagliardo, and that this same conduct also met the\nstandard for negligence set out in the jury instructions. The only conduct\nalleged to have caused Gagliardo’s injuries in the first amended complaint\nwas Diblin’s assaultive conduct. Thus, every cause of action asserted by\nGagliardo, including the cause of action for negligence, was based on Diblin’s\nphysical attack—not other conduct. And when the jury was asked to make\n\n\n                                        19\n\ffindings on these causes of action, it was not told that if it found there was\nliability for the attack under an intentional tort theory, the same conduct\ncould not then also support a finding of liability based on negligence. Nor\nwas the jury instructed that it could find Diblin negligent only if it\ndetermined the injury-producing conduct was unintended. Instead, the jury\nwas told that negligence “is the failure to use reasonable care to prevent\nharm to oneself or to others,” and that “[a] person is negligent if he or she\ndoes something that a reasonably careful person would not do in the same\nsituation or fails to do something that a reasonably careful person would do\nin the same situation.” This expressed “failure to use reasonable care”\nstandard is broad enough to include intentionally harmful conduct. In other\nwords, under these instructions, a jury could conclude that a person who\nintentionally injures another person has also failed to use reasonable care to\nprevent injury to another. Thus, in the absence of any instruction telling the\njury that a finding of liability for an intentional tort precludes a finding of\nnegligence based on the same conduct, a determination that the defendant\ncommitted gender violence could also support a negligence finding, i.e., that\nthe defendant did “something that a reasonably careful person would not do\nin the same situation.”\n      There is thus no inconsistency in the jury’s findings that Diblin was\nliable for Gagliardo’s injuries under both an intentional tort theory and a\nnegligence theory. And we have no reason to conclude the jury’s answers to\nthe special verdict questions regarding negligence should be understood to\nreflect a finding that Gagliardo’s injuries were the result of accidental\nconduct. Rather, the verdict form and the jury instructions confirm that the\njury believed Diblin’s injury-producing conduct was deliberate and\nintentional and that this deliberate conduct constituted a breach of the duty\n\n\n                                        20\n\fof care Diblin owed to Gagliardo. We therefore reject appellants’ contention\nthat the jury’s negligence determination in the underlying case mandated a\n\nfinding of coverage in this case. 3\n      3.    The Concurrent Independent Causes Doctrine Does Not Apply\n\n      Relying on State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Partridge (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9633133\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451519/state-farm-mutual-automobile-insurance-v-partridge/#97\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v.

Under\nthis doctrine, an insurer has a duty to indemnify an insured if a covered risk\nis a proximate cause of the injury, even if a noncovered risk also jointly\ncaused the injury in question.\n      According to appellants, there is no way to discern “that the conduct of\nDiblin the jury deemed to have been negligent is the same as whatever it\ndeemed to have been malicious, so it is not at all clear the jury perceived\nthere to be a single proximate cause” of Gagliardo’s injuries. Thus,\nappellants suggest, the jury could have concluded that Diblin’s negligent\n\n\n\n3      We also reject Diblin’s references to and reliance on the second\namended complaint to provide any basis for understanding the jury’s verdict\nin the underlying action. Although the superior court’s clerk’s office\npermitted the document to be filed approximately four years after judgment\nwas entered in this case, it is clear this document cannot be given any legal\neffect. A plaintiff may only amend a pleading as a matter of course before an\nanswer or demurrer is filed or before trial of the issue of law raised in the\ndemurrer; after any of these things happens, “the plaintiff’s right to amend as\na matter of course is gone.” (Loser v.

(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 472,\n473.) The record does not demonstrate Gagliardo sought or obtained leave to\nfile the purported second amended complaint in the underlying action when\nshe submitted it for filing. Absent the court granting Gagliardo permission to\namend the first amended complaint, the purported second amended\ncomplaint has no effect.\n                                       21\n\fconduct was different from the conduct that the jury found to be malicious.\nAnd, their argument goes, even if the special verdict is interpreted as\nexpressing that the jury found Diblin liable for an intentional tort (the gender\nviolence cause of action), which is a noncovered cause of the injuries, the jury\nmust have also found Diblin liable for different conduct amounting to\nnegligence, which is a covered cause of the injuries.\n      In appellants’ view, the evidence presented in the underlying trial not\nonly supported a theory of liability based on gender violence, but also\nsupported theories of liability related to Diblin’s “negligent management of\nhis own medical condition” or his negligent failure to warn Gagliardo that he\nwas feeling out of sorts and aggressive that morning. They argue that\nnegligence based on Diblin’s failure to manage the effects of his testosterone\nmedication or his failure to warn Gagliardo about those effects would be a\ncovered risk under the Policy. According to appellants, the jury may have\nfound him liable for these other types of conduct when the jury determined\nhis negligence caused Gagliardo’s injuries. However, Partridge and the law\nof concurrent independent causation does not assist appellants.\n      In Partridge, the insured was traveling in his car with a hunting gun\nhe had modified to create a “hair trigger” action. After the insured drove the\ncar off road, the car hit a bump and the gun fired, hitting and paralyzing a\npassenger, who sued. (</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9633133\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451519/state-farm-mutual-automobile-insurance-v-partridge/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Partridge\">Partridge, supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 10 Cal.3d at pp. 97–98.) The\ninsured’s homeowner’s liability policy covered liability resulting from the gun\nmodification, but it did not cover injuries arising out of the use of a motor\nvehicle. (Id. at pp. 102–103.) The Partridge court concluded that the fact\nthat the gun accidently fired in a car did not preclude coverage. (Ibid.)\nRather, where two independent risks jointly caused the injury, the insurer is\nliable so long as one of the risks is covered by the policy. (Id. at pp. 102–103.)\n\n\n                                       22\n\fThe Partridge court explained that “although the accident occurred in a\nvehicle, the insured’s negligent modification of the gun suffices, in itself, to\nrender him fully liable for the resulting injuries. . . . [I]nasmuch as the\nliability of the insured arises from his non-auto-related conduct, and exists\nindependently of any ‘use’ of his car, we believe the homeowner’s policy covers\nthat liability.” (Id. at p. 103.)\n      Concurrent independent causes “are multiple forces operating at the\nsame time and independently, each of which would have been sufficient by\nitself to bring about the harm.” (Viner v. Sweet (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639473\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639473/viner-v-sweet/#1240\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Viner v.

Gilstrap\">141 Cal.App.3d\n524, 530</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Safeco), the court distinguished Partridge on the ground the\nasserted concurrent causes were not independent of one another. The two\nasserted concurrent negligent acts at issue were the insured parents’\nnegligent entrustment of a motorcycle to their 14-year-old son, and the son’s\nnegligence in operating the motorcycle when he collided with another\nmotorcycle and injured a third party. (Id. at pp. 526, 527.) As the Safeco\ncourt explained, “[t]he separate and independent act in Partridge giving rise\nto liability was a ‘non-auto-related act,’ i.e., the filing of the gun trigger[, and\nt]hat act had nothing to do with the use or operation of a vehicle.” (Id. at\np. 527.) “In contrast to Partridge, the obligation of the insureds” in Safeco\n“did not arise from an act separate and independent from the use of the\n\n\n                                         23\n\fvehicle itself,” as the parents’ conduct in negligently entrusting the vehicle to\ntheir minor son could not “be disassociated from the use of the vehicle itself.”\n(Id. at pp. 527–528.) Ultimately the Safeco court determined the asserted\ncovered risk was not a concurrent independent cause of the third party’s\ninjury, as “the injury here involved no instrumentality other than the vehicle\nitself and . . . there would have been no accident without the use or operation\nof the motorcycle.” (Id. at pp. 530–531.)\n      And similarly in Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1042853\"><a href=\"/opinion/1042853/farmers-ins-exchange-v-superior-court-ca27/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court CA2/7\">220\nCal.App.4th 1199</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Farmers), the court explained why the Partridge rule did\nnot mandate coverage. The underlying claim in Farmers arose from the\naccident in which a grandfather ran over his granddaughter with his pickup\ntruck. (Id. at pp. 1204–1212.) There, the court considered whether the\ngrandfather’s negligent operation of his truck and the grandmother’s\nnegligent supervision of a child were independent concurrent causes of the\nchild’s fatal injuries. (Id. at p. 1208.) The Farmers court determined the\ncauses were not independent, and the homeowner’s policy exclusion for\ninjuries arising from use of a motor vehicle therefore applied. It explained\nthat in similar cases finding coverage barred, the excluded instrumentality\n“played an active role in causing the injury,” and the injury “ ‘involved no\ninstrumentality other than the [excluded instrumentality the] vehicle itself,’\nand ‘there would have been no accident without the use or operation of’ the\nvehicle.” (Id. at p. 1209, quoting Safeco, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2122767\"><a href=\"/opinion/2122767/safeco-insurance-v-gilstrap/#530\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Safeco Insurance v. Gilstrap\">141 Cal.App.3d at p. 530</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\nThe court found the grandmother’s “negligent supervision was not ‘separate\nand independent’ of [the grandfather’s] negligent automobile use because\nthere was only one way, one place, and one time [the grandmother’s]\nnegligence could give rise to liability: when [the grandfather] arrived home in\nhis truck.” (Farmers, at p. 1212.)\n\n\n                                       24\n\f      Applying Partridge and subsequent cases considering its rule, we must\nreject appellants’ contention regarding the applicability of the concurrent\nindependent causes doctrine. As a preliminary matter, as we have already\nexplained, we are unconvinced the jury’s verdict reflects that it was holding\nDiblin liable for two separate types of conduct when it found that Diblin\ncommitted gender violence and that he acted negligently. Again, the jury\nwas not told that finding specific damage-producing conduct was intentional\nwould preclude them from also finding that the same conduct was negligent.\nAbsent an instruction that a finding of liability on any of the intentional tort\ntheories would prevent a finding of negligence based on the same asserted\nconduct, one cannot presume that the jury relied on two different sets of\nconduct in finding that Diblin was liable for an intentional tort and for his\nnegligence.\n      But even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that appellants\nwere correct that the jury’s verdict could be interpreted as reflecting that the\njury found Diblin liable to Gagliardo based on two separate acts or omissions\n(one being his intentionally violent conduct and the other being his\nmismanagement of his medication and/or his failure to warn Gagliardo about\nthe side effects he was experiencing), the concurrent independent causes rule\ndoes not apply because the purported noncovered and covered causes of the\ninjury are not independent of each other. Appellants’ argument is that the\njury could have found Diblin liable on the gender violence cause of action\nbased on his conduct of deliberately striking Gagliardo with a mallet, and\nthat it also could have found him liable for negligence based on his failure to\nwarn Gagliardo or his failure to seek additional medical care to reduce the\nside effects of the testosterone. But unlike in Partridge, where the negligent\nfiling of the gun’s trigger mechanism and the negligent driving each could\n\n\n                                       25\n\fhave separately resulted in injury (see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9633133\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451519/state-farm-mutual-automobile-insurance-v-partridge/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v.

Partridge\">10 Cal.3d at p. 103</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">),\nthe failure to address the side effects of the testosterone or to warn Gagliardo\nabout his experience of the violent side effects were not risks that themselves\ncould have caused Gagliardo harm. It is only when these omissions are\ncoupled with Diblin’s violent conduct that any injury could have possibly\nresulted. In fact, Diblin’s theory of the role of his purported negligence\nregarding the side effects of the testosterone demonstrates the\ninterdependency of these two purported concurrent causes. Under Diblin’s\ntheory of what occurred, his aggression was a side effect of the testosterone\ntreatment, and it was this medication-induced aggression that led to his\nviolent conduct—conduct the underlying jury found constituted the\nintentional tort of gender violence. Thus, possible testosterone-related\nnegligence was “integrally connected to” (Prince v. United National Ins. Co.\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296832\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296832/prince-v-united-national-insurance/#245\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Prince v. United National Insurance\">142 Cal.App.4th 233, 245</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) Diblin’s intentional violent conduct, not\nindependent of it. Consequently, the concurrent independent causes rule set\nout in Partridge does not apply to mandate coverage, even assuming the jury\nin the underlying case found that Diblin was liable for Gagliardo’s injuries\nbased on the separate types of purportedly negligent conduct appellants’\nidentify on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       26\n\f   4. There Is No Need for a New Jury to Decide Whether Diblin Acted with a\n      “Preconceived Design to Injure”\n\n       In their final argument, appellants contend the trial court should not\n\nhave decided that Insurance Code section 533 4 and/or the express exclusion\nfor willful conduct set out in Section II of the Policy apply to exclude coverage\nfor the damages awarded in the underlying action. For example, appellants\nrely on Walters v. American Insurance Co. (1960) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2205214\"><a href=\"/opinion/2205214/walters-v-american-insurance/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Walters v. American Insurance\">185 Cal.App.2d 776</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and\nMeyer v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co.

Pacific Employers Insurance\">233 Cal.App.2d 321</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, among others,\nto assert the trial court should have empaneled a new jury for the specific\npurpose of determining whether Diblin acted with a “preconceived design to\ninjure.” According to appellants, these authorities require a jury to find that\nDiblin acted with a “preconceived design to injure” before the particular risk\nfrom that conduct can be excluded from coverage under the Policy’s willful\nconduct exclusion or the similar exclusion implied by Insurance Code section\n533.\n       Even assuming the cited authorities remain valid and that they require\na finding that Diblin acted with “preconceived design to injure” before a\nwillful acts exclusion may prevent coverage, there is no need for a jury to\nmake such a determination in this case. If a claim is not covered under a\npolicy’s coverage provisions, then there is no need to consider whether the\nclaim would be excluded under an exclusion provision. (See Rosen v. Nations\nTitle Ins. Co. (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251601\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251601/rosen-v-nations-title-insurance/#1497\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Rosen v. Nations Title Insurance\">56 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1497</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) As we have already\n\n\n\n4     Insurance Code section 533 provides, “An insurer is not liable for a loss\ncaused by the willful act of the insured; but he is not exonerated by the\nnegligence of the insured, or of the insured’s agents or others.” This provision\noperates as “ ‘an implied exclusionary clause which by statute is to be read\ninto all insurance policies.’ ” (J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M. K. (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9596126\"><a href=\"/opinion/1352735/j-c-penney-casualty-insurance-v-m-k/#1019\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: J. C.

Because the claim does not come within the coverage\nprovision, there is no need to consider the express exclusion provision in\nSection II of the Policy or the exclusion implied in every policy by Insurance\nCode section 533. Thus, the trial court made no error in declining to empanel\na new jury to determine whether Diblin acted with a “preconceived design to\ninjure.”\n                                        IV.\n                                  DISPOSITION\n         The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

Ct. No. NA076108)\n         v.\n\n RICHARD JOSEPH GOMEZ,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n      APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of\nLos Angeles County, James D. Otto, Judge. Reversed and\nremanded with instructions.\n      Bess Stiffelman, under appointment by the Court of\nAppeal, for Defendant and Appellant.\n      Rob Bonta, Attorney General, Lance E. Winters, Chief\nAssistant Attorney General, Susan Sullivan Pithey, Assistant\nAttorney General, Steven D. Matthews and J. Michael Lehmann\nDeputy Attorneys General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\f       Appellant Richard Gomez was convicted of murder and\nattempted murder when he was 17 years old and sentenced to an\naggregate term of 75 years to life. After 15 years in custody,\nappellant filed a petition for recall and resentencing pursuant to\nPenal Code section 1170, subdivision (d) (1170(d)). 1 Under that\nstatute, the trial court must recall and resentence a petitioner if\nit finds by a preponderance of the evidence that at least one of\nfour eligibility criteria is satisfied. After reviewing the parties’\nfilings, some of which are not included in the appellate record,\nand holding a hearing, the trial court found none of the criteria\nwas satisfied and denied the petition.\n       We conclude that the appellate record, limited though it is,\ncompels a finding that appellant committed the offense with an\nadult codefendant and accordingly reverse. The matter is\nremanded to the trial court to conduct a resentencing hearing in\naccordance with the relevant portions of section 1170(d). We\nexpress no opinion on how the court should exercise its\nsentencing discretion under section 1170(d). 2\n                            BACKGROUND\nI.     Charges and Conviction\n       An amended information filed on October 22, 2009 alleged\nthat appellant (born in 1989) and adult Melanie Gandara (born in\n1971) murdered victim Mary Castro (§ 187, subd. (a)) and\n\n1     All further statutory references are to the Penal Code\nunless otherwise indicated.\n2     Appellant also filed a related petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus, No. B346958. By order dated June 25, 2025, we indicated\nthat further consideration and determination of that petition\nwould be deferred until the instant appeal was considered by this\ncourt. The petition has now been considered and is denied as\nmoot by a concurrently filed separate order.\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fwillfully, deliberately, and with premeditation attempted to\nmurder victim Juan C. on or about April 29, 2007, when\nappellant was 17 years old. (§§ 187, subd. (a), 664.) The\ninformation alleged gang enhancements as to both charges\n(§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), and further alleged personal use\nfirearm enhancements against appellant only. (§ 12022.53,\nsubds. (b)-(d).) The information also alleged that appellant was a\nminor who was at least 16 years old at the time of the crimes\n(former Welf. & Inst. Code, § 707), and suffered two prior\nconvictions within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).\n       A jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder and\nwillful, premeditated, and deliberate attempted murder. It also\nfound the gang and personal use firearm allegations true. The\ncourt sentenced appellant to a term of 25 years to life for the\nmurder, plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the related\nfirearm enhancement. It imposed a consecutive sentence of life\nplus 25 years to life for the attempted murder and related\nfirearm enhancement. On both counts, the court imposed and\nstayed a 10-year sentence for the gang enhancement. The court\ndismissed the prior conviction allegations. Appellant’s aggregate\nsentence thus totaled 75 years to life.\n       Appellant appealed his conviction. A different panel of this\ncourt affirmed the judgment. (People v. Gomez (July 2, 2012, No.\nB225128) [nonpub. opn.].)\nII.    Section 1170(d) Proceedings\n       A.    Statute\n       Section 1170(d)(1)(A) provides that “[w]hen a defendant\nwho was under 18 years of age at the time of the commission of\nthe offense for which the defendant was sentenced to\nimprisonment for life without the possibility of parole [LWOP]\n\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fhas been incarcerated for at least 15 years, the defendant may\nsubmit to the sentencing court a petition for recall and\nresentencing.” 3 The petition must include “the defendant’s\nstatement that the defendant was under 18 years of age at the\ntime of the crime and was sentenced to life in prison without the\npossibility of parole” and “the defendant’s statement describing\ntheir remorse and work toward rehabilitation.” (§ 1170, subd.\n(d)(2).) It must also include the defendant’s statement that one of\nthe following four things is true:\n       “(A) The defendant was convicted pursuant to felony\nmurder or aiding and abetting murder provisions of law.\n       “(B) The defendant does not have juvenile felony\nadjudications for assault or other felony crimes with a significant\npotential for personal harm to victims prior to the offense for\nwhich the sentence is being considered for recall.\n       “(C) The defendant committed the crime with at least one\nadult codefendant.\n       “(D) The defendant has performed acts that tend to indicate\nrehabilitation or the potential for rehabilitation, including, but\nnot limited to, availing themselves of rehabilitative, educational,\nor vocational programs, if those programs have been available at\ntheir classification level and facility, using self-study for self-\nimprovement, or showing evidence of remorse.” (§ 1170, subds.\n(d)(2)(A)-(D).)\n       The People may, but are not required to, file a reply to the\npetition within 60 days of service. (§ 1170, subd. (d)(4).)\n       “If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that\none or more of the statements specified in subparagraphs (A) to\n\n3     Section 1170(d)(1)(B) sets forth eligibility limitations not\nrelevant here.\n\n\n\n                                  4\n\f(D), inclusive, of paragraph (2) is true, the court shall recall the\nsentence and commitment previously ordered and hold a hearing\nto resentence the defendant in the same manner as if the\ndefendant had not previously been sentenced, provided that the\nnew sentence, if any, is not greater than the initial sentence.”\n(§ 1170, subd. (d)(5).)\n        If the court does not recall the sentence, or resentences the\ndefendant to LWOP, the defendant may submit another petition\n“when the defendant has been committed to the custody of the\ndepartment for at least 20 years.” (§ 1170, subd. (d)(10).) “If the\nsentence is not recalled or the defendant is resentenced to\n[LWOP] under that petition, the defendant may file another\npetition after having served 24 years. The final petition may be\nsubmitted, and the response to that petition shall be determined,\nduring the 25th year of the defendant’s sentence.” (Ibid.)\n        B.     Petition\n        On January 2, 2024, appellant, through counsel, filed a\npetition for recall and resentencing under section 1170(d).\nAppellant asserted that he committed the murder and attempted\nmurder on April 29, 2007, and several additional unrelated\ncrimes for which he subsequently was sentenced, when he was\n17. He further asserted that his aggregate sentence of 75 years to\nlife, plus an additional 29 year sentence for the other crimes, was\na functional or “de facto LWOP sentence” and therefore entitled\nhim to seek section 1170, subdivision (d) relief under People v.\nHeard (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 608 (Heard).\n        Appellant asserted that he “has demonstrated, by a\npreponderance of the evidence” three of the four eligibility\ncriteria enumerated in subdivisions (d)(2)(A) through (D).\nSpecifically, he asserted that he “was convicted under a felony\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\fmurder or aiding and abetting theory of murder” (see § 1170,\nsubd. (d)(2)(A)); “[t]he crime was committed with an adult co-\ndefendant” (see § 1170, subd. (d)(2)(C)); and he “has performed\nacts that tend to indicate rehabilitation or the potential for\nrehabilitation” (see § 1170, subd. (d)(2)(D)). Appellant did not\ninvoke the fourth criterion related to juvenile felony\nadjudications. (§ 1170, subd. (d)(2)(B).)\n       Appellant attached several exhibits in support of his\npetition: (1) a May 27, 2010 minute order documenting his\nsentencing; (2) the appellate court opinion from his direct appeal;\n(3) a handwritten letter “express[ing his] remorse” and describing\nhis rehabilitative efforts; and (4) three laudatory chronos and six\ncertificates documenting those rehabilitative efforts. 4\n       C.     Opposition\n       On March 19, 2024, the People filed an opposition to\nappellant’s petition. They conceded that appellant’s sentence was\nthe functional equivalent of LWOP, but otherwise challenged his\neligibility for relief. The People asserted that appellant’s\n“statement of remorse and certificates of programs he has\nundertaken . . . are not clear proof of efforts toward rehabilitation\nas opposed to efforts to apply for resentencing.” They added that\nthey were “attempting to get the disciplinary record or ‘C’ file of\n\n\n\n4      Appellant also attached a March 17, 2021 minute order\namending nunc pro tunc an August 4, 2010 minute order to\nclarify that appellant was sentenced on that date to a total term\nof 29 years in state prison for three felony carjacking offenses\n(§ 215, subd. (a)) and related firearm enhancements (§ 12022.53,\nsubd. (b)). Appellant asserted that he committed these crimes on\nFebruary 1, 2007, February 11, 2007, March 19, 2007, and May 9,\n2007, when he was 17 years old.\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fMr. Gomez to whether [sic] he has in fact been participating in\nrehabilitative efforts.”\n      The People further asserted that “the crime at issue” was\nnot “in fact committed with an adult co-defendant” and “note[d]\nthat the co-defendant is currently fighting the legality of her\nsentence and disputes the factual basis of that conviction.”\nDespite appellant’s lack of reliance on the criterion related to\njuvenile felony adjudications, the People also argued that\nappellant had several adjudications that precluded relief,\nincluding the carjackings for which he was sentenced to 29 years\nand an earlier adjudication “for terrorist threats and exhibiting\nan imitation firearm.” The People did not address whether\nappellant was convicted under the felony murder doctrine or as\nan aider and abettor.\n      There is a page labeled “EXHIBIT” attached to the\nopposition, but the brief does not identify any attached exhibits\nand none appears to be included in the appellate record. 5 The\nPeople also stated during the hearing that they filed “a\nsupplemental” on April 23, 2024, but no document(s) fitting that\ndescription or filed on that date are included in the appellate\nrecord.\n      D.     Hearing and Ruling\n      Although section 1170(d) does not require that the trial\ncourt hold a hearing before ruling on a petition (see § 1170, subd.\n\n\n5     Appellant filed, and we granted, a motion to augment the\nappellate record with the amended information and the probation\nreport. The motion states only that these documents “are part of\nthen [sic] normal record on appeal, [and] were not included in the\nappellate record for this case”; it does not identify either as the\nmissing exhibit from the People’s opposition.\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\f(d); People v. Harring (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 483, 498 & fn. 5\n(Harring)), the trial court heard the matter on April 29, 2024.\n       “[I]n response to the People’s supplemental,” which, as\nnoted, is not in the appellate record, appellant’s counsel disputed\nthe People’s assertion that “there was no adult co-defendant.”\nCounsel argued, “She was charged. She was found guilty for this\noffense. Even if an 1172.6 was granted, she still has a conviction\nrelated to the offense for which Mr. Gomez— [sic]” The court\ninterjected that Gandara did “not have a conviction related to the\noffense,” because her “conviction was vacated” under section\n1172.6. Counsel responded that Gandara “was a participant,”\nand that “[w]e go back to the original time,” when Gandara was\ncharged and convicted. Counsel further asserted that appellant’s\nconvictions were obtained under a felony murder theory, because\n“it was a drug buy gone bad.” Additionally, she argued that “[w]e\njust need to show there is potential for rehabilitation, and in this\ncase we have.”\n       The court made the following findings and rulings: “Okay.\nAs to the first of the four criteria, whether Mr. Gomez was an\naider and abettor or under a felony murder, he was not because\nhis co-defendant’s conviction was vacated. He was the actual\nshooter according to the evidence in the case, and he was\nconvicted as the actual shooter. There was no evidence that\nanybody else was the actual shooter other than Mr. Gomez. [¶] As\nto number 2, he does have a juvenile record along with a\nconviction that happened after this case but for an event that\noccurred before this case. [¶] He did not act with a co-defendant\nbecause the co-defendant’s allegations were all found under\n1172.6 review to have – she did not act as a co-defendant or an\naider and abettor, and she was exonerated on that. Her\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\fconviction was vacated. She was re-sentenced only for the drug\nrelated crime.”\n       The court then asked the People if they wanted to be heard\nregarding appellant’s alleged rehabilitation. The People argued,\n“I think it’s very clear from the papers here that Mr. Gomez in no\nway, shape, or form has the potential for rehabilitation. He has\nseveral incidents since he’s been in prison. Most importantly, he\nhas an assault on a prisoner with great bodily injury in which he\nwas prosecuted by the local district attorney’s office near his\nprison, and he was sentenced to 12 additional years for that\noffense. Since that time he’s had additional batteries on\nprisoners. [¶] Just frankly, Your Honor, he’s been a menace in\nprison, and it is a farce to even say that he is close to showing\nthat he passed [sic] the potential for rehabilitation. Certainly he\nhas not. Based on his prison record, he has not rehabilitated, but\nhe has no potential for rehabilitation in the sense that he’s been\nhurting or harming fellow prisoners . . . almost from day 1 since\nhe’s been in prison.”\n       In response, appellant’s counsel acknowledged that\nappellant “did have issues, I guess, maybe initially going into\nprison,” as a “17-year-old going into a prison with adult prisoners,\nthat’s not an easy transition to make.” She argued that he had\nsince “shown potential for rehabilitation, which is reflected in the\nattachments to the petition.” Counsel emphasized that “we don’t\nneed to show 100 percent rehabilitation. We need to show a\npotential, which we have.”\n       The court found that appellant failed to meet the\nrehabilitation eligibility criterion. It explained, “I do not believe\nit’s been shown by a preponderance that he has performed those\nacts sufficiently to show rehabilitation or potential. I suppose\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\feverybody always has potential, and maybe in the future he will\nhave the potential and he will be able to show this, but he\ncertainly has not shown it at this point in time.” Because it found\nthat appellant did not meet any of the four eligibility criteria in\nsection 1170, subdivision (d)(2), the court denied the petition.\nAppellant timely appealed.\n                             DISCUSSION\n       Appellant contends that he met his burden on three of the\nfour eligibility criteria. 6 We begin and end our analysis with\nsection 1170(d)(2)(C), which we conclude is satisfied here.\n       A petitioner must establish the truth of at least one of the\neligibility criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.\n(§ 1170(d)(5); Harring, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at p. 502.) We\nreview the trial court’s factual determinations for substantial\nevidence, and its interpretation and application of the statute to\nthose factual findings de novo. (Id. at p. 495.)\n       The question under section 1170(d)(2)(C) is whether\nappellant “committed the offense with at least one adult\n\n6      Appellant also makes the necessary threshold argument\nthat he was sentenced to a term that is the functional equivalent\nof LWOP and therefore may seek section 1170(d) relief. (See\nPeople v. Sorto (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 435, 440; Heard, supra, 83\nCal.App.5th at pp. 633-634.) The question of where to draw that\nline is currently pending before the Supreme Court. (See People\nv. Munoz (2025) 110 Cal.App.5th 499, review granted June 25,\n2025, S290828 [“Is a juvenile homicide offender sentenced to 50\nyears to life in prison entitled to recall and resentencing under\nPenal Code section 1170, subdivision (d)(1) on the ground that\nthe sentence is the functional equivalent of life imprisonment\nwithout parole?”].) Respondent concedes that appellant’s\nsentence is the functional equivalent of LWOP for purposes of\neligibility for section 1170(d) relief; we accept the concession.\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fcodefendant.” (§ 1170(d)(2)(C).) The charging document in the\nappellate record establishes that appellant was charged jointly\nwith Melanie Gandara, who at age 35 was an adult at the time of\nthe crimes. Gandara therefore was an “adult codefendant”—but\ndid appellant “commit[ ] the offense with” her?\n       The trial court concluded, and respondent argues here, that\nthe answer to that question is no: “Gandara’s convictions were\nvacated [under section 1172.6] because she did not aid and abet\neither murder or attempted murder and ‘[s]he was re-sentenced\nonly for the drug-related crime.’” We presume these factual\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n(See Jameson v. Desta (2018) 5 Cal.5th 594, 608-609.) They are\nalso undisputed.\n       The dispute here is one of statutory interpretation, which\npresents a question of law. (Harring, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at p.\n495.) Respondent takes a narrow view of the language in section\n1170(d)(2)(C), asserting that the petitioner and adult codefendant\nmust factually, via their conduct, “commit” the same “offense” for\nwhich the petitioner was sentenced to LWOP or its equivalent.\nAppellant, on the other hand, takes a less restrictive view. He\ncontends the “statute’s plain language looks to the commission of\nthe offense, not the nature of any related convictions,” and\nGandara “remains convicted for her participation in the drug deal\nand related robbery, which led to the shooting.” 7 We conclude\nappellant has the better interpretation.\n\n\n7     Both parties rely on the factual recitations in the opinion\nresolving his direct appeal to support their assertions about the\nnature of the crime. “Whether and to what extent an opinion is\nprobative in a specific case must be decided on the facts of that\ncase.” (People v. Woodell (1998) 17 Cal.4th 448, 457.) We need\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f       “The fundamental task of statutory interpretation is to\ndetermine the Legislature’s intent so as to effectuate the law’s\npurpose.” (Harring, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at p. 495.) We start\nby looking at the words of the statute itself, affording them their\nplain and commonsense meaning. (Ibid.) “‘If the language is\nclear, courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a\nliteral interpretation would result in absurd consequences the\nLegislature did not intend.’” (Id. at p. 496.) If the language is\nsusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we may\nconsider the statutory purpose, legislative history, public policy,\nand other interpretative aids. (Ibid.) We strive to construe\nambiguous provisions reasonably, so as to “‘“‘“‘result in wise\npolicy rather than mischief or absurdity.’”’”’” (Ibid.)\n       As evidenced by the parties’ dueling interpretations, the\nlanguage “committed the offense with” is susceptible to more\nthan one reasonable interpretation. We accordingly look beyond\nthe plain language to the purpose of the statute. Section 1170(d)\ngenerally “was enacted in response to Graham [v. Florida (2010)\n560 U.S. 48,] which held that the imposition of an LWOP\nsentence on a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide\noffense violates the Eighth Amendment.” (People v. Lopez (2016)\n4 Cal.App.5th 649, 653 (Lopez).) The driving rationale was that\n“‘juveniles grow up; they change; they mature, and they should\nnot be denied the opportunity at some point to demonstrate that\nthey can be productive citizens of society.’” (Id. at p. 654.)\nRegarding the references to adult codefendants, “the Legislature\n\n\nnot make that determination here, as we presume the trial\ncourt’s factual findings that Gandara was but is no longer\nconvicted of at least one homicide offense stemming from the\nApril 2007 incident is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n                                12\n\fwas concerned about juveniles who were sentenced to LWOP for\ncrimes they committed while ‘“acting under the influence of an\nadult.”’” (People v. Willover (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 302, 321.)\n       It would be absurd to limit the scope of this concern to\njuveniles who were convicted of precisely the same “offense” as\nthe adult codefendant at issue. An adult may influence a juvenile\nto “commit” an “offense” even if the adult does not engage in\nidentical conduct or share the juvenile’s culpability. Moreover, it\nis not open to dispute on this record that Gandara was at one\npoint convicted of a homicide or attempted homicide offense\nstemming from the April 2007 incident for which appellant was\nconvicted and sentenced to the functional equivalent of LWOP.\nThat conviction has now been vacated and reduced many years\nlater due to a change in the law, but the fact remains that\nappellant established by a preponderance of the evidence that\nGandara was culpably involved in the overarching series of\nevents. Appellant’s eligibility for relief should not turn on the\nprecise character of Gandara’s conviction.\n       Lopez, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th 649, is instructive. There, two\ndefendants who were initially sentenced to LWOP as juveniles\nfiled habeas petitions that resulted in their sentences being\nreduced to life with the possibility of parole. (Lopez, supra, 4\nCal.App.5th at p. 652.) They subsequently filed petitions for\nrecall and resentencing under section 1170(d). (Ibid.) The People\nopposed the petitions, arguing as to one that “‘the ship has sailed\non resentencing’” because the LWOP sentence had already been\nreduced, and arguing as to the other that section 1170(d) was\ninapplicable to non-LWOP sentences. (Ibid.) The trial court\ngranted the petitions and resentenced the defendants, and the\nPeople appealed. (Ibid.) Lopez affirmed. Noting that section\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\f1170(d) “refers to the past,” the court observed that both\ndefendants “were sentenced to LWOP terms.” (Id. at p. 654.)\nThe court further reasoned that “modification of the LWOP\nsentences because of the Graham opinion should not render them\nineligible for resentencing. . . . ‘[I]t would be fundamentally\nunfair to deny [respondents] the benefit of the change in\nCalifornia law because [they] had already been benefited by the\ndecision made by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Graham\ndecision.’” (Ibid.)\n       Here, appellant and Gandara were both, in the past,\nconvicted of homicide offenses. Gandara subsequently benefitted\nfrom a favorable change in state law: her conviction was vacated\nand reduced to a lesser offense. It strikes us as fundamentally\nunfair to deny appellant the opportunity to seek relief under a\nstatute aimed at encouraging and rewarding rehabilitation of\njuvenile offenders because his adult codefendant independently\nbenefited from a separate legislative act of lenity. The record\nbefore the trial court established that Gandara, an adult who was\ncharged with the same crimes as appellant, was convicted of at\nleast one homicide or attempted homicide offense based upon her\nconduct with appellant. The lenity from which she later\nbenefited does not preclude appellant from seeking relief under\nsection 1170(d). The trial court erred in denying appellant’s\npetition on this basis.\n       We need not and do not consider the remainder of\nappellant’s claims.\n                           DISPOSITION\n       The trial court’s order denying appellant’s recall and\nresentencing petition under section 1170(d) is reversed.\nAppellant’s sentence is recalled pursuant to section 1170(d)(5),\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fand this case is remanded for the trial court to hold a\nresentencing hearing in accordance with the relevant provisions\nof section 1170(d). We express no opinion on how the court\nshould exercise its discretion in resentencing.\n\n              CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n\n\n                    COLLINS, ACTING P.

After 15 years in custody,\nappellant filed a petition for recall and resentencing pursuant to\nPenal Code section 1170, subdivision (d) (1170(d)). 1 Under that\nstatute, the trial court must recall and resentence a petitioner if\nit finds by a preponderance of the evidence that at least one of\nfour eligibility criteria is satisfied. After reviewing the parties’\nfilings, some of which are not included in the appellate record,\nand holding a hearing, the trial court found none of the criteria\nwas satisfied and denied the petition.\n       We conclude that the appellate record, limited though it is,\ncompels a finding that appellant committed the offense with an\nadult codefendant and accordingly reverse. The matter is\nremanded to the trial court to conduct a resentencing hearing in\naccordance with the relevant portions of section 1170(d). We\nexpress no opinion on how the court should exercise its\nsentencing discretion under section 1170(d). 2\n                            BACKGROUND\nI.     Charges and Conviction\n       An amended information filed on October 22, 2009 alleged\nthat appellant (born in 1989) and adult Melanie Gandara (born in\n1971) murdered victim Mary Castro (§ 187, subd. (a)) and\n\n1     All further statutory references are to the Penal Code\nunless otherwise indicated.\n2     Appellant also filed a related petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus, No. B346958. By order dated June 25, 2025, we indicated\nthat further consideration and determination of that petition\nwould be deferred until the instant appeal was considered by this\ncourt. The petition has now been considered and is denied as\nmoot by a concurrently filed separate order.\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fwillfully, deliberately, and with premeditation attempted to\nmurder victim Juan C. on or about April 29, 2007, when\nappellant was 17 years old. (§§ 187, subd. (a), 664.) The\ninformation alleged gang enhancements as to both charges\n(§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), and further alleged personal use\nfirearm enhancements against appellant only. (§ 12022.53,\nsubds. (b)-(d).) The information also alleged that appellant was a\nminor who was at least 16 years old at the time of the crimes\n(former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, § 707), and suffered two prior\nconvictions within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).\n       A jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder and\nwillful, premeditated, and deliberate attempted murder. It also\nfound the gang and personal use firearm allegations true. The\ncourt sentenced appellant to a term of 25 years to life for the\nmurder, plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the related\nfirearm enhancement. It imposed a consecutive sentence of life\nplus 25 years to life for the attempted murder and related\nfirearm enhancement. On both counts, the court imposed and\nstayed a 10-year sentence for the gang enhancement. The court\ndismissed the prior conviction allegations. Appellant’s aggregate\nsentence thus totaled 75 years to life.\n       Appellant appealed his conviction. A different panel of this\ncourt affirmed the judgment. (People v. Gomez (July 2, 2012, No.\nB225128) [nonpub. opn.].)\nII.    Section 1170(d) Proceedings\n       A.    Statute\n       Section 1170(d)(1)(A) provides that “[w]hen a defendant\nwho was under 18 years of age at the time of the commission of\nthe offense for which the defendant was sentenced to\nimprisonment for life without the possibility of parole [LWOP]\n\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fhas been incarcerated for at least 15 years, the defendant may\nsubmit to the sentencing court a petition for recall and\nresentencing.” 3 The petition must include “the defendant’s\nstatement that the defendant was under 18 years of age at the\ntime of the crime and was sentenced to life in prison without the\npossibility of parole” and “the defendant’s statement describing\ntheir remorse and work toward rehabilitation.” (§ 1170, subd.\n(d)(2).) It must also include the defendant’s statement that one of\nthe following four things is true:\n       “(A) The defendant was convicted pursuant to felony\nmurder or aiding and abetting murder provisions of law.\n       “(B) The defendant does not have juvenile felony\nadjudications for assault or other felony crimes with a significant\npotential for personal harm to victims prior to the offense for\nwhich the sentence is being considered for recall.\n       “(C) The defendant committed the crime with at least one\nadult codefendant.\n       “(D) The defendant has performed acts that tend to indicate\nrehabilitation or the potential for rehabilitation, including, but\nnot limited to, availing themselves of rehabilitative, educational,\nor vocational programs, if those programs have been available at\ntheir classification level and facility, using self-study for self-\nimprovement, or showing evidence of remorse.” (§ 1170, subds.\n(d)(2)(A)-(D).)\n       The People may, but are not required to, file a reply to the\npetition within 60 days of service. (§ 1170, subd. (d)(4).)\n       “If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that\none or more of the statements specified in subparagraphs (A) to\n\n3     Section 1170(d)(1)(B) sets forth eligibility limitations not\nrelevant here.\n\n\n\n                                  4\n\f(D), inclusive, of paragraph (2) is true, the court shall recall the\nsentence and commitment previously ordered and hold a hearing\nto resentence the defendant in the same manner as if the\ndefendant had not previously been sentenced, provided that the\nnew sentence, if any, is not greater than the initial sentence.”\n(§ 1170, subd. (d)(5).)\n        If the court does not recall the sentence, or resentences the\ndefendant to LWOP, the defendant may submit another petition\n“when the defendant has been committed to the custody of the\ndepartment for at least 20 years.” (§ 1170, subd. (d)(10).) “If the\nsentence is not recalled or the defendant is resentenced to\n[LWOP] under that petition, the defendant may file another\npetition after having served 24 years. The final petition may be\nsubmitted, and the response to that petition shall be determined,\nduring the 25th year of the defendant’s sentence.” (Ibid.)\n        B.     Petition\n        On January 2, 2024, appellant, through counsel, filed a\npetition for recall and resentencing under section 1170(d).\nAppellant asserted that he committed the murder and attempted\nmurder on April 29, 2007, and several additional unrelated\ncrimes for which he subsequently was sentenced, when he was\n17. He further asserted that his aggregate sentence of 75 years to\nlife, plus an additional 29 year sentence for the other crimes, was\na functional or “de facto LWOP sentence” and therefore entitled\nhim to seek section 1170, subdivision (d) relief under People v.\nHeard (2022) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">83 Cal.App.5th 608</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Heard).\n        Appellant asserted that he “has demonstrated, by a\npreponderance of the evidence” three of the four eligibility\ncriteria enumerated in subdivisions (d)(2)(A) through (D).\nSpecifically, he asserted that he “was convicted under a felony\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\fmurder or aiding and abetting theory of murder” (see § 1170,\nsubd. (d)(2)(A)); “[t]he crime was committed with an adult co-\ndefendant” (see § 1170, subd. (d)(2)(C)); and he “has performed\nacts that tend to indicate rehabilitation or the potential for\nrehabilitation” (see § 1170, subd. (d)(2)(D)). Appellant did not\ninvoke the fourth criterion related to juvenile felony\nadjudications. (§ 1170, subd. (d)(2)(B).)\n       Appellant attached several exhibits in support of his\npetition: (1) a May 27, 2010 minute order documenting his\nsentencing; (2) the appellate court opinion from his direct appeal;\n(3) a handwritten letter “express[ing his] remorse” and describing\nhis rehabilitative efforts; and (4) three laudatory chronos and six\ncertificates documenting those rehabilitative efforts. 4\n       C.     Opposition\n       On March 19, 2024, the People filed an opposition to\nappellant’s petition. They conceded that appellant’s sentence was\nthe functional equivalent of LWOP, but otherwise challenged his\neligibility for relief. The People asserted that appellant’s\n“statement of remorse and certificates of programs he has\nundertaken . . . are not clear proof of efforts toward rehabilitation\nas opposed to efforts to apply for resentencing.” They added that\nthey were “attempting to get the disciplinary record or ‘C’ file of\n\n\n\n4      Appellant also attached a March 17, 2021 minute order\namending nunc pro tunc an August 4, 2010 minute order to\nclarify that appellant was sentenced on that date to a total term\nof 29 years in state prison for three felony carjacking offenses\n(§ 215, subd. (a)) and related firearm enhancements (§ 12022.53,\nsubd. (b)). Appellant asserted that he committed these crimes on\nFebruary 1, 2007, February 11, 2007, March 19, 2007, and May 9,\n2007, when he was 17 years old.\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fMr. Gomez to whether [sic] he has in fact been participating in\nrehabilitative efforts.”\n      The People further asserted that “the crime at issue” was\nnot “in fact committed with an adult co-defendant” and “note[d]\nthat the co-defendant is currently fighting the legality of her\nsentence and disputes the factual basis of that conviction.”\nDespite appellant’s lack of reliance on the criterion related to\njuvenile felony adjudications, the People also argued that\nappellant had several adjudications that precluded relief,\nincluding the carjackings for which he was sentenced to 29 years\nand an earlier adjudication “for terrorist threats and exhibiting\nan imitation firearm.” The People did not address whether\nappellant was convicted under the felony murder doctrine or as\nan aider and abettor.\n      There is a page labeled “EXHIBIT” attached to the\nopposition, but the brief does not identify any attached exhibits\nand none appears to be included in the appellate record. 5 The\nPeople also stated during the hearing that they filed “a\nsupplemental” on April 23, 2024, but no document(s) fitting that\ndescription or filed on that date are included in the appellate\nrecord.\n      D.     Hearing and Ruling\n      Although section 1170(d) does not require that the trial\ncourt hold a hearing before ruling on a petition (see § 1170, subd.\n\n\n5     Appellant filed, and we granted, a motion to augment the\nappellate record with the amended information and the probation\nreport. The motion states only that these documents “are part of\nthen [sic] normal record on appeal, [and] were not included in the\nappellate record for this case”; it does not identify either as the\nmissing exhibit from the People’s opposition.\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\f(d); People v. Harring (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">69 Cal.App.5th 483</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 &amp; fn. 5\n(Harring)), the trial court heard the matter on April 29, 2024.\n       “[I]n response to the People’s supplemental,” which, as\nnoted, is not in the appellate record, appellant’s counsel disputed\nthe People’s assertion that “there was no adult co-defendant.”\nCounsel argued, “She was charged. She was found guilty for this\noffense. Even if an 1172.6 was granted, she still has a conviction\nrelated to the offense for which Mr. Gomez— [sic]” The court\ninterjected that Gandara did “not have a conviction related to the\noffense,” because her “conviction was vacated” under section\n1172.6. Counsel responded that Gandara “was a participant,”\nand that “[w]e go back to the original time,” when Gandara was\ncharged and convicted. Counsel further asserted that appellant’s\nconvictions were obtained under a felony murder theory, because\n“it was a drug buy gone bad.” Additionally, she argued that “[w]e\njust need to show there is potential for rehabilitation, and in this\ncase we have.”\n       The court made the following findings and rulings: “Okay.\nAs to the first of the four criteria, whether Mr. Gomez was an\naider and abettor or under a felony murder, he was not because\nhis co-defendant’s conviction was vacated. He was the actual\nshooter according to the evidence in the case, and he was\nconvicted as the actual shooter. There was no evidence that\nanybody else was the actual shooter other than Mr. Gomez. [¶] As\nto number 2, he does have a juvenile record along with a\nconviction that happened after this case but for an event that\noccurred before this case. [¶] He did not act with a co-defendant\nbecause the co-defendant’s allegations were all found under\n1172.6 review to have – she did not act as a co-defendant or an\naider and abettor, and she was exonerated on that. Her\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\fconviction was vacated. She was re-sentenced only for the drug\nrelated crime.”\n       The court then asked the People if they wanted to be heard\nregarding appellant’s alleged rehabilitation. The People argued,\n“I think it’s very clear from the papers here that Mr. Gomez in no\nway, shape, or form has the potential for rehabilitation. He has\nseveral incidents since he’s been in prison. Most importantly, he\nhas an assault on a prisoner with great bodily injury in which he\nwas prosecuted by the local district attorney’s office near his\nprison, and he was sentenced to 12 additional years for that\noffense. Since that time he’s had additional batteries on\nprisoners. [¶] Just frankly, Your Honor, he’s been a menace in\nprison, and it is a farce to even say that he is close to showing\nthat he passed [sic] the potential for rehabilitation. Certainly he\nhas not. Based on his prison record, he has not rehabilitated, but\nhe has no potential for rehabilitation in the sense that he’s been\nhurting or harming fellow prisoners . . . almost from day 1 since\nhe’s been in prison.”\n       In response, appellant’s counsel acknowledged that\nappellant “did have issues, I guess, maybe initially going into\nprison,” as a “17-year-old going into a prison with adult prisoners,\nthat’s not an easy transition to make.” She argued that he had\nsince “shown potential for rehabilitation, which is reflected in the\nattachments to the petition.” Counsel emphasized that “we don’t\nneed to show 100 percent rehabilitation. We need to show a\npotential, which we have.”\n       The court found that appellant failed to meet the\nrehabilitation eligibility criterion. It explained, “I do not believe\nit’s been shown by a preponderance that he has performed those\nacts sufficiently to show rehabilitation or potential. I suppose\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\feverybody always has potential, and maybe in the future he will\nhave the potential and he will be able to show this, but he\ncertainly has not shown it at this point in time.” Because it found\nthat appellant did not meet any of the four eligibility criteria in\nsection 1170, subdivision (d)(2), the court denied the petition.\nAppellant timely appealed.\n                             DISCUSSION\n       Appellant contends that he met his burden on three of the\nfour eligibility criteria. 6 We begin and end our analysis with\nsection 1170(d)(2)(C), which we conclude is satisfied here.\n       A petitioner must establish the truth of at least one of the\neligibility criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.\n(§ 1170(d)(5); Harring, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at p. 502.) We\nreview the trial court’s factual determinations for substantial\nevidence, and its interpretation and application of the statute to\nthose factual findings de novo. (Id. at p. 495.)\n       The question under section 1170(d)(2)(C) is whether\nappellant “committed the offense with at least one adult\n\n6      Appellant also makes the necessary threshold argument\nthat he was sentenced to a term that is the functional equivalent\nof LWOP and therefore may seek section 1170(d) relief. (See\nPeople v. Sorto (2024) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">104 Cal.App.5th 435</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440; Heard, supra, 83\nCal.App.5th at pp. 633-634.) The question of where to draw that\nline is currently pending before the Supreme Court. (See People\nv. Munoz (2025) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">110 Cal.App.5th 499</span><pre class=\"inline\">, review granted June 25,\n2025, S290828 [“Is a juvenile homicide offender sentenced to 50\nyears to life in prison entitled to recall and resentencing under\nPenal Code section 1170, subdivision (d)(1) on the ground that\nthe sentence is the functional equivalent of life imprisonment\nwithout parole?”].) Respondent concedes that appellant’s\nsentence is the functional equivalent of LWOP for purposes of\neligibility for section 1170(d) relief; we accept the concession.\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fcodefendant.” (§ 1170(d)(2)(C).) The charging document in the\nappellate record establishes that appellant was charged jointly\nwith Melanie Gandara, who at age 35 was an adult at the time of\nthe crimes. Gandara therefore was an “adult codefendant”—but\ndid appellant “commit[ ] the offense with” her?\n       The trial court concluded, and respondent argues here, that\nthe answer to that question is no: “Gandara’s convictions were\nvacated [under section 1172.6] because she did not aid and abet\neither murder or attempted murder and ‘[s]he was re-sentenced\nonly for the drug-related crime.’” We presume these factual\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n(See Jameson v. Desta (2018) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4291703\"><a href=\"/opinion/4514450/jameson-v-desta/#608\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Jameson v. Desta\">5 Cal.5th 594, 608-609</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) They are\nalso undisputed.\n       The dispute here is one of statutory interpretation, which\npresents a question of law. (Harring, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at p.\n495.) Respondent takes a narrow view of the language in section\n1170(d)(2)(C), asserting that the petitioner and adult codefendant\nmust factually, via their conduct, “commit” the same “offense” for\nwhich the petitioner was sentenced to LWOP or its equivalent.\nAppellant, on the other hand, takes a less restrictive view. He\ncontends the “statute’s plain language looks to the commission of\nthe offense, not the nature of any related convictions,” and\nGandara “remains convicted for her participation in the drug deal\nand related robbery, which led to the shooting.” 7 We conclude\nappellant has the better interpretation.\n\n\n7     Both parties rely on the factual recitations in the opinion\nresolving his direct appeal to support their assertions about the\nnature of the crime. “Whether and to what extent an opinion is\nprobative in a specific case must be decided on the facts of that\ncase.” (People v.

We need\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f       “The fundamental task of statutory interpretation is to\ndetermine the Legislature’s intent so as to effectuate the law’s\npurpose.” (Harring, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at p. 495.) We start\nby looking at the words of the statute itself, affording them their\nplain and commonsense meaning. (Ibid.) “‘If the language is\nclear, courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a\nliteral interpretation would result in absurd consequences the\nLegislature did not intend.’” (Id. at p. 496.) If the language is\nsusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we may\nconsider the statutory purpose, legislative history, public policy,\nand other interpretative aids. (Ibid.) We strive to construe\nambiguous provisions reasonably, so as to “‘“‘“‘result in wise\npolicy rather than mischief or absurdity.’”’”’” (Ibid.)\n       As evidenced by the parties’ dueling interpretations, the\nlanguage “committed the offense with” is susceptible to more\nthan one reasonable interpretation. We accordingly look beyond\nthe plain language to the purpose of the statute. Section 1170(d)\ngenerally “was enacted in response to Graham [v. Florida (2010)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6680682\"><a href=\"/opinion/6795859/graham-v-florida/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Graham v. Florida\">560 U.S. 48</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,] which held that the imposition of an LWOP\nsentence on a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide\noffense violates the Eighth Amendment.” (People v. Lopez (2016)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4092656\"><a href=\"/opinion/4315395/people-v-lopez/#653\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Lopez\">4 Cal.App.5th 649, 653</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Lopez).) The driving rationale was that\n“‘juveniles grow up; they change; they mature, and they should\nnot be denied the opportunity at some point to demonstrate that\nthey can be productive citizens of society.’” (Id. at p. 654.)\nRegarding the references to adult codefendants, “the Legislature\n\n\nnot make that determination here, as we presume the trial\ncourt’s factual findings that Gandara was but is no longer\nconvicted of at least one homicide offense stemming from the\nApril 2007 incident is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n                                12\n\fwas concerned about juveniles who were sentenced to LWOP for\ncrimes they committed while ‘“acting under the influence of an\nadult.”’” (People v. Willover (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3215563\"><a href=\"/opinion/3215669/people-v-willover/#321\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Willover\">248 Cal.App.4th 302, 321</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n       It would be absurd to limit the scope of this concern to\njuveniles who were convicted of precisely the same “offense” as\nthe adult codefendant at issue. An adult may influence a juvenile\nto “commit” an “offense” even if the adult does not engage in\nidentical conduct or share the juvenile’s culpability. Moreover, it\nis not open to dispute on this record that Gandara was at one\npoint convicted of a homicide or attempted homicide offense\nstemming from the April 2007 incident for which appellant was\nconvicted and sentenced to the functional equivalent of LWOP.\nThat conviction has now been vacated and reduced many years\nlater due to a change in the law, but the fact remains that\nappellant established by a preponderance of the evidence that\nGandara was culpably involved in the overarching series of\nevents. Appellant’s eligibility for relief should not turn on the\nprecise character of Gandara’s conviction.\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4092656\"><a href=\"/opinion/4315395/people-v-lopez/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

There, two\ndefendants who were initially sentenced to LWOP as juveniles\nfiled habeas petitions that resulted in their sentences being\nreduced to life with the possibility of parole. (Lopez, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4092656\"><a href=\"/opinion/4315395/people-v-lopez/#652\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Lopez\">4\nCal.App.5th at p. 652</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) They subsequently filed petitions for\nrecall and resentencing under section 1170(d). (Ibid.) The People\nopposed the petitions, arguing as to one that “‘the ship has sailed\non resentencing’” because the LWOP sentence had already been\nreduced, and arguing as to the other that section 1170(d) was\ninapplicable to non-LWOP sentences. (Ibid.) The trial court\ngranted the petitions and resentenced the defendants, and the\nPeople appealed. (Ibid.) Lopez affirmed. Noting that section\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\f1170(d) “refers to the past,” the court observed that both\ndefendants “were sentenced to LWOP terms.” (Id. at p. 654.)\nThe court further reasoned that “modification of the LWOP\nsentences because of the Graham opinion should not render them\nineligible for resentencing. . . . ‘[I]t would be fundamentally\nunfair to deny [respondents] the benefit of the change in\nCalifornia law because [they] had already been benefited by the\ndecision made by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Graham\ndecision.’” (Ibid.)\n       Here, appellant and Gandara were both, in the past,\nconvicted of homicide offenses. Gandara subsequently benefitted\nfrom a favorable change in state law: her conviction was vacated\nand reduced to a lesser offense. It strikes us as fundamentally\nunfair to deny appellant the opportunity to seek relief under a\nstatute aimed at encouraging and rewarding rehabilitation of\njuvenile offenders because his adult codefendant independently\nbenefited from a separate legislative act of lenity. The record\nbefore the trial court established that Gandara, an adult who was\ncharged with the same crimes as appellant, was convicted of at\nleast one homicide or attempted homicide offense based upon her\nconduct with appellant. The lenity from which she later\nbenefited does not preclude appellant from seeking relief under\nsection 1170(d). The trial court erred in denying appellant’s\npetition on this basis.\n       We need not and do not consider the remainder of\nappellant’s claims.\n                           DISPOSITION\n       The trial court’s order denying appellant’s recall and\nresentencing petition under section 1170(d) is reversed.\nAppellant’s sentence is recalled pursuant to section 1170(d)(5),\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fand this case is remanded for the trial court to hold a\nresentencing hearing in accordance with the relevant provisions\nof section 1170(d). We express no opinion on how the court\nshould exercise its discretion in resentencing.\n\n              CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n\n\n                    COLLINS, ACTING P.

Among other things, this court\nheld that, although the 2022 Resolution largely involved administrative acts\nnot subject to the referendum power, adoption of the resolution was a\nlegislative act because, for the first time, it authorized the construction of and\n\n\n\n\n                                        1\n\fimprovements to a new public park, to be called Veterans Park. 1 (Move Eden\nI, at pp. 269, 275–278.)\n      Following the decision in Move Eden I, the City repealed the 2022\nResolution and enacted a new resolution (the 2024 Resolution) that approves\nthe same agreement approved in the 2022 Resolution, except it omits the\nprovisions related to the construction of Veterans Park that were central to\nthis court’s decision in Move Eden I. Move Eden moved for an order\ncompelling the City to comply with the writ of mandate, arguing that\nadoption of the 2024 Resolution violated section 9241 of the Elections Code, 2\nwhich provides that an ordinance not submitted to the voters must be\n“entirely repeal[ed]” and prohibits reenactment of a repealed ordinance “for a\nperiod of one year after the date of its repeal by the legislative body.” The\ntrial court granted the motion.\n      We reverse. Consistent with the scope of the referendum power, we\nconclude that section 9241 did not prohibit the City from adopting the 2024\nResolution, which involves only administrative acts implementing prior\nlegislative determinations not challengeable by referendum.\n                               BACKGROUND 3\n      The present appeal involves a proposed residential development in\ndowntown Livermore (the Project), at the location of a former supermarket,\nin an area bounded by Railroad Avenue, Livermore Avenue, First Street, and\n\n\n      1 The 2022 Resolution referred to the park as Veteran’s Park and the\n\nsubsequent enactment at issue in the present appeal refers to Veterans Park;\nwe use the more recent spelling herein.\n\n      2 All undesignated section references are to the Elections Code.\n\n\n      3 Aside from the post-remand developments, this background is drawn\n\nfrom this court’s prior decision, Move Eden I, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th 263.\n\n                                       2\n\fL Street (the Property). (See Save Livermore Downtown v. City of Livermore\n(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 1116, 1122 (Save Livermore Downtown) [describing the\nProject in a proceeding challenging the City’s compliance with environmental\nand zoning laws].)\n      In 2008, the City’s former redevelopment agency acquired the Property\nusing the City’s inclusionary housing funds, and, in 2009, a portion of the\npurchase price was refinanced using “Residential Development Loan\nProgram” funds from the State of California. The funds were awarded to the\nCity for “site acquisition and pre-development expenses” in the City’s\ndowntown. The City loaned the funds to the former redevelopment agency,\nand a deed restriction was recorded requiring any development of the\nProperty to include “at least” 28 units of “low-income” housing and 56 units of\n“moderate-income” housing.\n      In 2018, the City and Eden Housing entered into a Disposition and\nDevelopment and Loan Agreement for development of the Property (2018\nAgreement). The 2018 Agreement recited that, in January, the city council\n“approved the development of the Livermore Village Site[4] to include a public\npark, up to 130 units of workforce housing, a science center, a black box\ntheater, and retail space.” The City selected Eden Housing to develop\nhousing at the Property, and the agreement states a portion of the Property\n“will be dedicated to the City for a park.” The City agreed, after satisfaction\nof various conditions, to sell the Property to Eden Housing for the Property’s\nfair market value at the time of sale and to make “a future acquisition loan to\n[Eden Housing] in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Property.”\n      In December 2020, the City reviewed “Conceptual Plans” and\n“instructed staff to move forward” (capitalization omitted) with the Project.\n\n\n      4 The Livermore Village Site is a larger area that includes the Property.\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fIn May 2021, the City approved land use entitlements for the Project, subject\nto conditions. That same month, the City approved an amended development\nagreement (2021 Agreement). The approval resolution and the 2021\nAgreement recited that the City and Eden Housing “wish to amend the [2018\nAgreement] to clarify the definition of the Property subject to transfer by City\nfor development of the Project, define development and financial obligations\nfor [Veterans] Park” and other matters. With respect to the park, the 2021\nAgreement stated, “[a]t City’s option, City and Developer may negotiate a\nfuture construction and reimbursement agreement with Developer to\ncoordinate the construction of the [Veterans] Park Improvements. These\nimprovements would be exclusive of any development loan provided by the\nCity for development of the Project.”\n      In June 2021, a group known as Save Livermore Downtown filed a\npetition for a writ of mandate contending that the City violated the California\nEnvironmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) and state\nand local planning and zoning laws in approving the Project. The trial court\ndenied the petition and this court affirmed. (Save Livermore Downtown,\nsupra, 87 Cal.App.5th 1116.)\n      On May 24, 2022, the City adopted the 2022 Resolution, Resolution No.\n2022-085, which was the subject of Move Eden I. The 2022 Resolution\nauthorized the execution of an “Amended and Restated Disposition,\nDevelopment and Loan Agreement” for the Project (2022 Agreement). Among\nother provisions, the 2022 Agreement reflects the City’s decision to spend\n$5.5 million on constructing and improving Veterans Park as part of the\nProject. In particular, the agreement provides, “The Parties agree that the\nDeveloper will manage the construction of the [Veterans] Park Improvements\nbut that the City will pay for the costs of the [Veterans] Park Improvements\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fat its sole expense. City and Developer will negotiate a future construction\nmanagement and reimbursement agreement to coordinate the construction of\nthe [Veterans] Park Improvements. The Agreement shall authorize\nreimbursement for the construction of the park, per the designs and\nspecifications issued by the City, and shall not exceed [$5.5 million] . . .\nwithout additional approval of the City Council.”\n      On May 27, 2022, the City Clerk was provided a proposed summary of\nthe 2022 Resolution for the purpose of a proposed referendum on the\nresolution. On June 3, Move Eden was formed to, among other things,\npromote the qualification of the proposed referendum. On July 8, the\nreferendum proponents submitted a referendum petition to the City Clerk\nwith more than the required number of signatures to qualify the referendum\nfor the November 2022 ballot.\n      On July 13, 2022, the City Clerk stated in a letter that, “[b]ased on the\nadvice from the City Attorney and special counsel, . . . the City has\ndetermined that Resolution No. 2022-085 was an administrative act, not a\nlegislative act, and not subject to referendum.”\n      In August 2022, Move Eden filed a petition for writ of mandate\n(Petition) seeking to compel the City and the City Clerk to process the\nreferendum petition in accordance with the Elections Code.\n      In January 2023, the trial court denied the Petition on the merits. The\ncourt concluded the 2022 Resolution was not subject to challenge by\nreferendum because it was an administrative act or, in the alternative,\nbecause the City acted as an administrative agent of the state in adopting it.\nThe court concluded that either it was lawful for the City Clerk to refuse to\nprocess the referendum petition, or it is proper to “ ‘retroactively validate[]’ ”\nthe conclusion that the proposed referendum is invalid, even if the City Clerk\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fviolated the law. The trial court denied the Petition, and the appeal resulting\nin Move Eden I followed.\n      In Move Eden I, this court reversed, concluding that the City Clerk\ncould not refuse to process the referendum based on advice from the City that\nthe 2022 Resolution was an administrative act, and that the City did not act\nas an administrative agent of the state in adopting the resolution. (Move\nEden I, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at pp. 273–276, 278–284.) This court further\nheld that adoption of the 2022 Resolution was a legislative act subject to\nchallenge by referendum because “[t]he 2022 Agreement, for the first time,\nauthorizes the construction of and improvements to [Veterans] Park.” (Id. at\np. 277.) 5 Finally, in an unpublished portion of the decision, this court held\nthe City did not act legislatively in approving loan terms and an indemnity\nprovision relating to hazardous waste in the 2022 Resolution. We remanded\nto the trial court with directions “to issue a peremptory writ of mandate\nordering [the City Clerk and the City] to process the referendum petition as\nrequired by the Elections Code.” (Move Eden I, at p. 286.) 6\n      On remand, the trial court issued a writ of mandate compelling the\nCity to process Move Eden’s referendum petition “as required by the\nElections Code.” The City Clerk processed the referendum petition by\ndelivering it to the Alameda County Registrar of Voters. After the\nreferendum was certified, it was presented to the city council for a decision\n\n\n      5 In its opening brief, the City presents information and arguments\n\nregarding the status of Veterans Park prior to adoption of the 2022\nResolution; those matters were not presented to this court in the Move Eden I\nappeal, and the City identifies no relevance to the issues in the present\nappeal. (See Move Eden I, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at p. 277.)\n\n      6 We also reversed the trial court’s order requiring Move Eden to file an\n\nundertaking under Code of Civil Procedure section 529.2.\n\n                                        6\n\fwhether to repeal the 2022 Resolution or to place it on a ballot for voter\napproval. On June 24, 2024, the city council repealed the 2022 Resolution in\nResolution No. 2024-108, reciting that the City “respects the Appellate\nCourt’s opinion that the approval of the construction of and improvements to\nVeterans Park is a legislative act, and the will of the voters to set aside that\nact, and hereby repeals” the 2022 Resolution. Separately but on the same\nday, the city council adopted the 2024 Resolution, Resolution No. 2024-109,\nwhich reaffirms the 2022 Agreement, except for all provisions pertaining to\nthe construction of and improvements to Veterans Park. The 2024\nResolution states that the City “ratifies, reaffirms, and readopts the [City’s]\nexecution of the [2022 Agreement], except for the language for the\nconstruction of and improvement to Veterans [P]ark, and hereby\nacknowledges that the remaining language of the agreement remains in full\nforce and effect as of the date the agreement was signed.” The 2024\nResolution included, as exhibits, the 2022 Resolution with the original 2022\nAgreement and a document indicating the provisions in the agreement\nrelating to Veterans Park that have been “pulled from the agreement.” 7\n      Move Eden moved for an order compelling compliance with the writ of\nmandate, arguing adoption of the 2024 Resolution violated section 9241. The\ntrial court granted the motion, finding that “the new 2024 resolution was\nsubstantially similar to the original one, with the exclusion of the Veterans\nPark provisions, and not ‘essentially different,’ ” and concluding that the City\nviolated section 9241 because the City “effectively repealed only part of the\noriginal resolution” and because “the new resolution cannot be enacted for a\nperiod of a year following the repeal.”\n\n\n      7 The City actually took all these steps to comply with the Move Eden I\n\ndecision before the trial court issued its writ of mandate in July 2024.\n\n                                          7\n\f      The present appeal followed.\n                                 DISCUSSION\nI.    Standard of Review\n      A traditional writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section\n1085 “ ‘is used to compel a public entity to perform a legal and usually\nministerial duty.’ ” (Schmid v. City & County of San Francisco (2021) 60\nCal.App.5th 470, 484–485.) Generally, a reviewing court “may reverse a trial\ncourt’s determination of whether there has been compliance with its writ only\nfor abuse of discretion.” (Summit Media, LLC v. City of Los Angeles (2015)\n240 Cal.App.4th 171, 182.) But “[w]here questions of law are presented, the\nappellate court conducts an independent review and does not defer to the\ntrial court’s decision.” (San Bernardino County Fire Protection Dist. v.\nPage (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 791, 802.) “Statutory interpretation is ‘an issue\nof law, which we review de novo.’ ” (Union of Medical Marijuana Patients,\nInc. v. City of San Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1183; see also Robles v.\nEmployment Development Dept. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 530, 546.) “[T]he use\nof an incorrect legal standard necessarily constitutes an abuse of discretion.”\n(Cisneros v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 381, 422.)\n      Because resolution of the issues on appeal requires interpretation of\nsection 9241, our review is de novo. (Lindelli v. Town of San Anselmo (2003)\n111 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1104 (Lindelli) [“The trial court’s determination that\n[respondents’] actions did not violate the Elections Code is a legal finding\nsubject to independent review”].) “ ‘As in any case involving statutory\ninterpretation, our fundamental task here is to determine the Legislature’s\nintent so as to effectuate the law’s purpose.’ [Citation.] The well-established\nrules for performing this task require us to begin by examining the statutory\nlanguage, giving it a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\fnot, however, consider the statutory language in isolation; rather, we look to\nthe statute’s entire substance in order to determine its scope and purposes.\n[Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question in context, keeping in\nmind the statute’s nature and obvious purposes. [Citation.] We must\nharmonize the statute’s various parts by considering it in the context of the\nstatutory framework as a whole. [Citation.] If the statutory language is\nunambiguous, then its plain meaning controls. If, however, the language\nsupports more than one reasonable construction, then we may look to\nextrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the\nlegislative history.” (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority v. Alameda Produce Market, LLC (2011) 52 Cal.4th 1100, 1106–\n1107.) A critical part of the framework for interpreting section 9241 is the\n“ ‘constitutional scheme.’ ” (County of Kern v. Alta Sierra Holistic Exchange\nService (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 82, 93–94, 101 (County of Kern) [construing\nsection 9145, a related provision applicable to counties].)\nII.   The Referendum Power\n      “Under the California Constitution, ‘[t]he legislative power of this State\nis vested in the California Legislature . . . but the people reserve to\nthemselves the powers of initiative and referendum.’ (Cal. Const., art. IV,\n§ 1.) . . . The initiative power allows voters to propose new measures and\nplace them on the ballot for a popular vote. If the measure is approved by\npopular vote, it becomes law. (Cal. Const., art. II, §§ 8, 10, subd. (a).) The\nreferendum power, by contrast, allows voters to weigh in on laws that have\nalready been passed by their elected representatives. Any voter or group of\nvoters that gathers enough signatures can place a legislative enactment on\nthe ballot for an up or down vote. A referendum suspends operation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\flaw until it is approved by a majority of voters.” (Wilde v. City of Dunsmuir\n(2020) 9 Cal.5th 1105, 1111 (Wilde).)\n      “Under . . . section 9237, if a petition protesting the adoption of an\nordinance is signed by more than 10 percent of the voters of the city, ‘the\neffective date of the ordinance shall be suspended and the legislative body\nshall reconsider the ordinance.’ ” (Save Lafayette v. City of Lafayette (2018)\n20 Cal.App.5th 657, 663.) Section 9241 provides in relevant part, “If the\nlegislative body does not entirely repeal the ordinance against which the\npetition is filed, the legislative body shall submit the ordinance to the voters\n. . . . The ordinance shall not become effective until a majority of the voters\nvoting on the ordinance vote in favor of it. If the legislative body repeals the\nordinance or submits the ordinance to the voters, and a majority of the voters\nvoting on the ordinance do not vote in favor of it, the ordinance shall not\nagain be enacted by the legislative body for a period of one year after the date\nof its repeal by the legislative body or disapproval by the voters.” 8\n      “The Constitution ‘speaks of the initiative and referendum, not as a\nright granted the people, but as a power reserved by them.’ [Citation.] Since\nthen, courts have consistently declared it their duty to ‘ “jealously guard” ’\nand liberally construe the right so that it ‘ “be not improperly annulled.” ’\n[Citations.] Moreover, when weighing the tradeoffs associated with the\ninitiative [or referendum] power, we have acknowledged the obligation to\n\n\n      8 Section 9241 was enacted as part of a recodification of the Elections\n\nCode that involved no substantive changes. (Stats. 1994, ch. 920, § 2.) The\n“entirely repeal” language now in section 9241 was first enacted in 1911\n(Stats. 1911, ch. 33), following amendment of the California Constitution to\nprovide for the initiative and referendum powers. (See Associated Home\nBuilders etc., Inc. v. City of Livermore (1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 591 (Associated\nHome Builders).) The “shall not again be enacted” language now in section\n9241 (the stay provision) was enacted in 1949. (Stats. 1949, ch. 194, § 1.)\n\n                                        10\n\fresolve doubts in favor of the exercise of the right whenever possible.”\n(California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland (2017) 3 Cal.5th 924, 934;\nsee also Associated Home Builders, supra, 18 Cal.3d at p. 591.)\n      Nevertheless, “ ‘[w]hile it has been generally said that the reserved\npower of initiative and referendum . . . is to be liberally construed to uphold it\nwhenever reasonable [citations], it is established beyond dispute that the\npower of referendum may be invoked only with respect to matters which are\nstrictly legislative in character [citations]. Under an unbroken line of\nauthorities, administrative or executive acts are not within the reach of the\nreferendum process [citations]. The plausible rationale for this rule espoused\nin numerous cases is that to allow the referendum or initiative to be invoked\nto annul or delay the executive or administrative conduct would destroy the\nefficient administration of the business affairs of a city or municipality\n[citations].’ ” (City of San Diego v. Dunkl (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 384, 399\n(Dunkl); see also San Bruno Committee for Economic Justice v. City of San\nBruno (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 524, 530 (San Bruno) [“Courts have long\nobserved that ‘[t]he power of referendum applies only to acts that are\nlegislative in character; executive or administrative acts are not within the\nscope of that remedy’ ”]; Yost v. Thomas (1984) 36 Cal.3d 561, 569 (Yost)\n[“The powers of referendum and initiative apply only to legislative acts by a\nlocal governing body”]; Housing Authority v. Superior Court (1950) 35 Cal.2d\n550, 557 [“The power of referendum applies only to acts that are legislative in\ncharacter; executive or administrative acts are not within the scope of that\nremedy”]; accord, Move Eden I, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at pp. 275–276.)\n“ ‘This legislative-administrative dichotomy reflects a determination to\nbalance the ideal of direct legislation by the people against the practical\nnecessity of freeing municipal governments from time consuming and costly\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\freferenda on merely administrative matters.’ ” (San Bruno, at p. 530; accord,\nMove Eden I, at p. 276.)\n       “Although the test is not precise and the published decisions reflect\nsome inconsistency in approach, ‘[l]egislative acts generally are those which\ndeclare a public purpose and make provisions for the ways and means of its\naccomplishment. Administrative acts, on the other hand, are those which are\nnecessary to carry out the legislative policies and purposes already declared\nby the legislative body.’ [Citation.] Alternatively stated, ‘ “[t]he power to be\nexercised is legislative in its nature if it prescribes a new policy or plan;\nwhereas, it is administrative in its nature if it merely pursues a plan already\nadopted by the legislative body itself, or some power superior to it.” ’ ” (San\nBruno, supra, 15 Cal.App.5th at p. 530; accord, Move Eden I, supra, 100\nCal.App.5th at p. 276.)\nIII.   The City Did Not Violate Section 9241\n       The trial court concluded the City failed to comply with the writ of\nmandate because it did not, in effect, “entirely repeal” the 2022 Resolution\nwithin the meaning of section 9241, and because adoption of the 2024\nResolution violated section 9241’s one-year stay provision. Both arguments\nturn on the proper construction of section 9241.\n       It is important to make several observations at the outset. The\nunderlying 2022 Agreement is an expansive agreement covering a wide range\nof issues related to construction of the Project, an affordable workforce\nhousing development in the City’s downtown. In Move Eden I, supra, 100\nCal.App.5th at page 277, this court held that only one aspect of the\nagreement involved legislative determinations—to wit, “The 2022 Agreement,\nfor the first time, authorizes the construction of and improvements to\n[Veterans] Park” as part of the Project. That determination meant that\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\fadoption of the 2022 Resolution, which approved the 2022 Agreement, was a\nlegislative act subject to challenge by referendum. (Id. at pp. 275–278.) But\nwe were clear, in an unpublished portion of the opinion, that that did not\nmean that approval of the remaining aspects of the 2022 Agreement was\nlegislative, pointing out that Move Eden had cited “no authority that or\nreasoning why a determination that is otherwise administrative may be\ntreated as legislative because the provision at issue is part of a larger\nagreement, the approval of which is legislative due to a wholly unrelated\nprovision.” In the present appeal, Move Eden emphasizes that the 2024\nResolution approves virtually the same underlying agreement as the 2022\nResolution, with only the Veterans Park provisions removed. But Move Eden\ndoes not dispute that the remaining aspects of the agreement involve only\nadministrative determinations and that those determinations implement\nlegislative decisions made long before the 2022 Resolution and never\nchallenged by referendum. 9 And Move Eden does not dispute that the\nreferendum power applies only to legislative acts, and it does not suggest that\nthe 2024 Resolution, which involves only administrative acts, is\n\n\n\n\n      9 Move Eden argued in the previous appeal that approval of loan terms\n\nand an indemnification provision in the 2022 Agreement was legislative, but\nour rejection of that contention in the unpublished portion of Move Eden I is\nnow law of the case. (People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 441.) Move Eden\nrelies on a footnote in the same unpublished portion of Move Eden I to argue\nthat the law of the case doctrine somehow precludes the City’s argument that\nthe trial court erred in applying section 9241 to the 2024 Resolution. Move\nEden’s argument is misplaced because we did not address section 9241 in\nMove Eden I. In the footnote at issue, we addressed only the City’s new\nrequest at oral argument that it be permitted to proceed with a referendum\non only the Veterans Park provisions, and we observed only that the City\nfailed to provide authority supporting the request.\n\n                                       13\n\findependently subject to challenge by referendum. These considerations are\ncritical to our application of section 9241 in the present case.\n      A.     The 2022 Resolution Was “Entirely Repealed”\n      Section 9241 provides that, “[i]f the legislative body does not entirely\nrepeal the ordinance against which the petition is filed, the legislative body\nshall submit the ordinance to the voters . . . .” It is undisputed that the City\ndid, literally, “entirely repeal” the 2022 Resolution. But the trial court\nconcluded the City did not repeal the resolution within the meaning of section\n9241 because the City also adopted the 2024 Resolution, which reaffirmed the\n2022 Agreement except for the provisions relating to Veterans Park. The\ntrial court erred. 10\n      Move Eden relies on the decision in County of Kern v. T.C.E.F., Inc.\n(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 301, 308 (TCEF). There, the Kern County Board of\nSupervisors adopted an ordinance banning medical marijuana dispensaries.\n(Id. at p. 310.) After voters challenged the ordinance through a referendum\npetition, the county opted to repeal not only the ordinance, but the entire\nsection of the county’s ordinance code addressing medical marijuana\ndispensaries, resulting in a de facto ban. (Id. at p. 312.) In considering\nwhether the ordinance had been entirely repealed, 11 the court reasoned that\n\n\n      10 We have reviewed the legislative history to the 1911 enactment\n\n(Stats. 1911, ch. 33) that added the “entirely repeal” language now in section\n9241 (see fn. 8, ante), but we found nothing helpful to resolving the issues in\nthe present appeal.\n\n      11 TCEF applied section 9145, which governs the referendum process\n\nfor counties. Like section 9241, section 9145 uses the phrase “entirely\nrepeal.” “Section 9241 is more detailed than section 9145 because it includes\na sentence that the ordinance repealed by the board and rejected by the\nvoters ‘shall not again be enacted by the legislative body for a period of one\nyear.’ ” (TCEF, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 321, fn. 10.)\n\n                                       14\n\f“the proper scope of the inquiry is the totality of the circumstances of a\nparticular case,” and that courts must look at “the practical effect” of the\nactions an agency takes “because substance, not form, is the proper test for\ndetermining the real character of conduct or a transaction.” (TCEF, at pp.\n322–323.) From that perspective, to “entirely repeal” an ordinance, an\nagency must “(1) revoke the protested ordinance in all its parts and (2)\nrefrain from additional action that has the practical effect of implementing\nthe essential feature of the protested ordinance.” (Id. at p. 323.) In TCEF,\nbecause the county’s repeal of the prior code sections had the “practical effect\nof implementing the essential feature of the protested ordinance—namely, a\nban on dispensaries,” the county did not entirely repeal the ordinance. (Id. at\npp. 324–325.)\n      Here, the City “revoke[d] [the 2022 Resolution] in all its parts.” (TCEF,\nsupra, 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 323.) The trial court so acknowledged, observing\nthat the City adopted “a new resolution that repealed Resolution [No.] 2022-\n085” and the “parties all agree that these steps were consistent with, and\nwould satisfy, the writ of mandate.” Move Eden argues adoption of the 2024\nResolution rendered the repeal ineffective as to most aspects of the 2022\nAgreement, but that is relevant to the second, “practical effect” aspect of the\nTCEF test, not to the question of whether the resolution was fully revoked.\n      In applying that second aspect, the critical task is identifying “the\nessential feature of the protested ordinance.” (TCEF, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 323.) We conclude that the only reasonable understanding of “essential\nfeature” is that, at a minimum, it must include a legislative act that made the\nprior ordinance subject to challenge by referendum in the first place. To\nconclude otherwise ignores that the entire rationale for the TCEF decision\nwas protection of the referendum power, which only reaches legislative acts.\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fAs the court explained, “it is reasonable to regard the protest petition as a\nchallenge or legislative check aimed at the essential (i.e., important,\nprincipal) subject matter of the protested ordinance—the ban on medical\nmarijuana dispensaries. We adopt a relatively narrow legal test as that test\nis sufficient to deal with the facts of this case, while serving the statutory\npurpose of protecting the referendum power.” (Id. at p. 322; see also id. at p.\n325 [“Allowing County to achieve the practical equivalent of a dispensary ban\nby alternate means would render section 9145’s protections of the referendum\npower so ineffectual that the referendum process would no longer\n‘guarantee[] to the citizens an ultimate check on legislative power’ ”].)\n      It is critical to understand that TCEF involved unusual circumstances\nin which a legislative body was able to achieve the same legislative objective\nas a prior enactment by a subsequent enactment that was not substantially\nsimilar to the original enactment. (See TCEF, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at p.\n325 [“Under the unusual facts of this case, however, the board of supervisors’\ngeneral authority to legislate is limited by the protections section 9145\naffords the referendum process”].) Where a legislative body repeals a\nchallenged ordinance but then takes another, different action that\nundermines the repeal of the prior legislative act, the legislative body\neffectively interferes with the referendum power. Here, the trial court\nconcluded it was “too clever by half to say that the City ‘entirely repealed’ the\noriginal resolution when it immediately substituted almost all of the original\nlanguage in the replacement resolution.” But we understand the purpose of\nsection 9241 differently. Because the administrative acts in the 2022\nResolution were not an essential feature of the resolution for purposes of\nsection 9241, and because the 2024 Resolution does not have the “practical\neffect” of undermining repeal of the Veterans Park provisions (the only\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\flegislative aspect of the prior enactment), the trial court improperly extended\nthe referendum power to reach purely administrative acts when it concluded\nthe City failed to entirely repeal the 2022 Resolution due to adoption of the\n2024 Resolution. 12\n      Finally, although Move Eden provides no reason why administrative\nacts not subject to the referendum power can be considered an “essential\nfeature” of an ordinance for purposes of section 9241, Move Eden focuses on\nlanguage in the 2024 Resolution that purports to leave undisturbed all parts\nof the 2022 Agreement other than the Veterans Park provisions. In\nparticular, the 2024 Resolution states, the “remaining language of the [2022]\n[A]greement remains in full force and effect as of the date the agreement was\nsigned.” But, although that language undermines the practical effect of\nrepeal of the 2022 Resolution as to the administrative acts therein, nothing in\nthe 2024 Resolution undermines the repeal of the Veterans Park provisions,\nwhich are the only essential features of the 2022 Resolution for purposes of\nsection 9241.\n      The trial court erred in concluding the City failed to “entirely repeal”\nthe 2022 Resolution within the meaning of section 9241.\n      B.    The 2024 Resolution Did Not Violate the Section 9241 Stay\n      In the alternative, Move Eden contends that adoption of the 2024\nResolution violated the portion of section 9241 providing that “the ordinance\nshall not again be enacted by the legislative body for a period of one year\n\n\n\n      12 See also the discussion below (Part III.B., post) regarding\n\ninterpretation of the section 9241 stay provision. The reasons for concluding\nthat provision did not prohibit the 2024 Resolution—respecting the scope of\nthe referendum power, preserving the ability of government to function, and\nproviding a principled basis for decisionmaking—are equally applicable to\nconstruing the section 9241 repeal provision.\n\n                                       17\n\fafter the date of its repeal by the legislative body or disapproval by the\nvoters.” We reject the contention.\n      “The function of the stay provision is to enforce the electorate’s power\nto approve or reject measures provisionally adopted by a legislative body\nbefore they take effect. If the stay provision were interpreted to apply only to\nthe specific measure challenged by referendum, the referendum power could\nbe ‘completely nullified.’ [Citation.] ‘[T]he legislative body could by merely\namending [the challenged ordinance] in a minor way and adding additional\nmatters, then adopt in its entirety the legislative act objected to in the\nreferendum petition. If such were the law, the council merely by continuous\namendment of that act could deprive the voters of ever having an act either\nrepealed or brought to a vote.’ [Citation.] For this reason, the stay is not\nconfined to the specific ordinance and its exact terms. It extends to repassage\nof the challenged ordinance with minor amendments. This rule is ‘inherent\nin the very principle of the referendum and the spirit of the section.’\n[Citation.] ‘If such were not the case, no referendum could ever be brought to\na conclusion, because a council could prevent it by recurrent amendments to\nthe disputed legislative act.’ ” (Lindelli, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1109–\n1110.)\n      However, “[t]he stay provision does not tie a legislative body’s hands\nentirely. It does not prevent a legislative body or a city council from adopting\nany [and all] measures involving the same subject matter. In determining\nwhether a subsequently enacted ordinance violates the [section 9241] stay\n. . . , we ask ‘whether the second legislative enactment is essentially the same\nas the first.’ ” (Lindelli, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at p. 1110; see also\nRubalcava v. Martinez (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 563, 569–570 (Rubalcava).)\n“The legislative body may not violate that stay by enacting essentially\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\fidentical legislation on the same subject matter.” (Lindelli, at p. 1111.) This\nrule is “an implied element of the constitutional provisions reserving the\nreferendum power.” (Rubalcava, at p. 573.)\n      In Lindelli, the Town of San Anselmo awarded a waste management\nfranchise to a new provider in place of the incumbent; after opponents\nqualified a referendum on the franchise, the town accepted bids for an\ninterim contract and then awarded the new provider the interim contract\nuntil the referendum election. (Lindelli, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1102–\n1103.) Lindelli held that the interim contract violated the section 9241 stay.\nThe court focused “on the features that gave rise to popular objection,”\nobserving that it was the “change in provider, and not the length of the\nfranchise grant, that inspired the referendum.” (Id. at p. 1111.) Because “the\ninterim contract differ[ed] from the original franchise only in the length of\ntime covered,” its adoption violated section 9241. (Lindelli, at p. 1111; see\nalso Martin v. Smith (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 115, 121 [the “essential features\n[of the original enactment] were the approval of the proposed commercial\ndevelopment and the granting of the lease and sublease”].)\n      The present case involves additional considerations not present in\nLindelli. Move Eden points out that the 2024 Resolution “preserved the vast\nmajority” of the 2022 Agreement; that the referendum objected to approval of\nthe Project as a whole, not just to approval of Veterans Park; and that the\n2024 Resolution restored the Project. However, the critical difference\nbetween the present case and Lindelli is that, in Lindelli, the service provider\nchanges (in both the original and the subsequent enactment) were\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f“legislative” decisions “subject to the referendum process.” 13 (Lindelli, supra,\n111 Cal.App.4th at p. 1113.) In the present case, the determination to move\nforward with the Project as a whole (but without Veterans Park) was not\nsubject to challenge by referendum, and the 2024 Resolution contains no\nlegislative acts. As the City points out, and Move Eden does not dispute, “the\nlegislative polices supporting those administrative actions to implement the\nhousing project . . . had been approved long before” the 2022 Resolution and\nwere not “targeted by a referendum effort at the time of adoption.” (See, e.g.,\nSan Bruno, supra, 15 Cal.App.5th at p. 533 [“We agree with the City that the\nadoption of the resolution was an administrative act because it implements\nprior legislative action”]; Dunkl, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th at p. 400 [“Once a\nlegislative policy has been established, the administrative acts that follow\ntherefrom are not subject to referendum or initiative”]; Lincoln Property Co.\nNo. 41, Inc. v. Law (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 230, 235 [“since the legislative\nobjectives and conditions of development were laid down” in a previous\nenactment, and the challenged acts “were done merely to carry out the\nlegislative policies already declared, the [challenged resolution] must be\nclassified as a purely administrative act which is not subject to the\nreferendum process”].)\n      In interpreting the stay provision in section 9241, courts have\ninterpreted the word “ordinance” to include not only an identical enactment\nbut also a subsequent enactment that is “essentially the same” as the original\n\n\n\n\n      13 Lindelli noted, “ ‘[t]he rule is firmly established that the granting of a\n\nfranchise by a city or county is a legislative act.’ ” (Lindelli, supra, 111\nCal.App.4th at p. 1113.)\n\n\n                                        20\n\fenactment. 14 The present case requires that we further construe section\n9241, to determine whether a subsequent ordinance may be considered\n“essentially the same” if it does not include any legislative act that made the\noriginal enactment subject to the referendum power in the first place. 15 We\nconclude that, in determining whether a subsequent enactment is essentially\nthe same, the relevant comparison is with the legislative act or acts in the\n\n\n\n      14 The roots of the “essentially the same” formulation are in In re\n\nStratham (1920) 45 Cal.App. 436, decided prior to the enactment of the stay\nprovision in 1949 (Stats. 1949, ch. 194, § 1; see fn. 8, ante). In Stratham, the\ncourt stated, “The council may, however, deal further with the subject matter\nof the suspended ordinance, by enacting an ordinance essentially different\nfrom the ordinance protested against.” (Stratham, at p. 440.) Stratham’s\n“essentially different” language evolved into the “essentially the same”\nformulation. (See Rubalcava, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 569–570, 574–\n575.) We have reviewed the legislative history to the 1949 enactment, and\nhave found nothing helpful to resolving the issue in the present appeal.\nNevertheless, we may presume that, in enacting the language now in section\n9241, the Legislature was aware of Stratham and expected that courts would\nconstrue the “ordinance” that could not be re-enacted in a consistent manner.\n(White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 572 [“when the Legislature\namends a statute, we presume it was fully aware of the prior judicial\nconstruction”].) And, of course, courts have continued to use Stratham’s\napproach in applying the language now in section 9241. In any event, our\nultimate task is to further construe and apply section 9241 in the\ncircumstances of this case in light of the referendum power the statute seeks\nto effectuate.\n\n      15 The parties discuss the decision in Gilbert v. Ashley (1949) 93\n\nCal.App.2d 414, 415, on this point, but that case is inapposite. There, the\nsubsequent ordinance was not subject to referendum under an exception for\ntax levies for the usual current expenses of a city (id. at p. 415), so the court\ndid not address the legislative-administrative dichotomy. And, although the\ncourt observed that the enactments were materially different (ibid.), the\ncourt had no occasion to consider whether the essential aspects of an\nordinance are the legislative acts that made the original ordinance subject to\nthe referendum power.\n\n                                       21\n\foriginal enactment that made the enactment subject to the referendum\npower. Several principles lead us to conclude this is the most reasonable\ninterpretation of section 9241.\n      First, section 9241 is part of the referendum process and it must be\nconstrued accordingly. Just as “[t]he Elections Code . . . may be reasonably\ninterpreted as providing for the use of referendum only with respect to such\nordinances as are constitutionally subject to referendum” (Geiger v. Board of\nSupervisors (1957) 48 Cal.2d 832, 839 (Geiger)), the section 9241 stay\nprovision should be construed to prohibit an enactment only where necessary\nto protect the referendum power. (See also People v. Superior Court\n(Zamudio) (2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 193 [“wherever possible, ‘we will interpret a\nstatute as consistent with applicable constitutional provisions, seeking to\nharmonize Constitution and statute’ ”].) As noted previously, it is well-\nestablished that the referendum power extends only to enactments that are\nan exercise of a governing body’s legislative powers. (Dunkl, supra, 86\nCal.App.4th at p. 399 [“ ‘it is established beyond dispute that the power of\nreferendum may be invoked only with respect to matters which are strictly\nlegislative in character [citations]. Under an unbroken line of authorities,\nadministrative or executive acts are not within the reach of the referendum\nprocess’ ”]; see also, e.g., Yost, supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 569; Move Eden I, supra,\n100 Cal.App.5th at pp. 275–276; accord, Wilde, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1115, fn.\n2.) Thus, construing the section 9241 stay to prohibit only enactments that\nreadopt a legislative aspect of a challenged ordinance (either expressly or\neffectively) is consistent with the reach of the referendum power. In contrast,\nMove Eden’s construction of section 9241 would be an unprecedented\nextension of the referendum power to prohibit entirely administrative acts.\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\f      Second, Move Eden’s interpretation of section 9241 would undermine\nessential government functions for no purpose consistent with the\nreferendum power. As the Supreme Court observed in construing the scope\nof a provision exempting tax levies from referendum, “[i]f essential\ngovernmental functions would be seriously impaired by the referendum\nprocess, the courts, in construing the applicable constitutional and statutory\nprovisions, will assume that no such result was intended.” (Geiger, supra, 48\nCal.2d at p. 839; accord, Wilde, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1123.) In the present\ncase, it is undisputed that the legislative decisions about the Project that are\nimplemented by the administrative provisions in both the 2022 and 2024\nResolutions were made long before adoption of the 2022 Resolution and were\nnot challenged by referendum. Although the referendum challenging the\n2022 Resolution had the effect of delaying the administrative acts in the\nresolution as well as the new legislative approval of Veterans Park, the\nreferendum power does not justify Move Eden’s effort to frustrate the City’s\nability to take administrative actions to move forward with previously\napproved aspects of the Project following repeal of the 2022 Resolution.\n      “California has a housing supply and affordability crisis of historic\nproportions.” (Gov. Code, § 65589.5, subd. (a)(2)(A); see also California\nRenters Legal Advocacy & Education Fund v. City of San Mateo (2021) 68\nCal.App.5th 820, 830; Anderson v. City of San Jose (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th\n683, 705–712.) As Eden Housing points out and Move Eden does not dispute,\ndelays in construction projects can be very costly and, in some circumstances,\ncan threaten the viability of a project. (See, e.g., Note, Addressing Challenges\nto Affordable Housing in Land Use Law: Recognizing Affordable Housing as a\nRight (2022) 135 Harv. L.Rev. 1104, 1113, fn. 70 [“some have observed that\nwhen it comes to authorizing development, ‘delay is as good as denial,’\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\f[citation], and opponents of affordable housing have actively pursued delay as\na method of preventing development, [citation]. In addition to the costs of\nfighting for authorization, delay creates a risk of rising construction costs and\nchanged market conditions.”].) The City’s compliance with this court’s\ndecision in Move Eden I by eliminating from the 2024 Resolution the sole\nlegislative determination in the 2022 Resolution is sufficient to protect the\nreferendum power. Move Eden’s construction of section 9241 would allow the\nreferendum power “ ‘to be invoked to annul or delay . . . administrative\nconduct’ ” and “ ‘would destroy the efficient administration of the business\naffairs of’ ” the City as to a long-planned affordable workforce housing\ndevelopment, for no purpose consistent with the referendum power. (Dunkl,\nsupra, 86 Cal.App.4th at p. 399; see also Simpson v. Hite (1950) 36 Cal.2d\n125, 134 [“The initiative or referendum is not applicable where ‘the inevitable\neffect would be greatly to impair or wholly destroy the efficacy of some other\ngovernmental power, the practical application of which is essential’ ”]; accord,\nWilde, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1124, fn. 9.) It would be unreasonable to\nconclude that was the intent behind section 9241. 16\n      Finally, Move Eden’s construction of section 9241, focusing on the\nquantitative similarities between the 2022 and 2024 Resolutions as a whole,\nfails to provide a principled basis for decisionmaking. Under its approach,\n\n\n\n      16 To be clear, we need not and do not rely on a “broad proposition that\n\nthe powers of direct democracy are not to be interpreted to defeat essential\ngovernment functions.” (Wilde, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1124, fn. 9.) As we\nhave explained, the 2024 Resolution is outside the scope of the referendum\npower, so our holding does not impinge on the constitutional powers of direct\ndemocracy. Nevertheless, that Move Eden’s construction of section 9241\nwould disrupt essential government functions for no purpose consistent with\nthe referendum power is a relevant consideration in determining whether the\nLegislature intended to prohibit enactments like the 2024 Resolution.\n\n                                       24\n\fwhat percentage of a resolution must be changed in order to avoid a\ndetermination that a subsequent enactment is “essentially the same”? Could\nthe City have enacted a resolution that only readopted the Veterans Park\nprovisions? Such a narrow enactment would not be similar in scope or\ncontent to the expansive 2022 Resolution, but it would be absurd to conclude\nthe City could readopt the single legislative determination that made the\noriginal resolution subject to the referendum power. In contrast, our\nconstruction of section 9241 provides a bright line for decisionmaking by\nmaking it clear that the focus must be on whether the subsequent enactment\neffectuates a legislative act in the repealed enactment. (See People v.\nCoronado (1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [“ ‘We must select the construction that\ncomports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a\nview to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\nand avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences’ ”].)\n      In arguing the section 9241 stay provision reaches administrative\nactions, Move Eden relies heavily on one sentence from the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2\nCal.5th 141, 160. But the Court there addressed an entirely different issue.\nIn Orange Citizens, the City of Orange amended its general plan to permit\nthe development of residential housing in an area previously designated for a\ngolf course or open space. (Id. at pp. 146–150.) When a group of citizens\nqualified a referendum to challenge the amendment, the city took the\nposition that (1) a 1973 resolution that was adopted but never implemented\nthrough changes to the city’s maps permitted residential housing in the\ndesignated area; and (2) the referendum was, therefore, irrelevant since the\nchallenged recent amendment “was not required to permit” the development.\n(Id. at pp. 147, 150.) The main question addressed by Orange Citizens was\n\n\n\n                                      25\n\f“whether the 1973 resolution [was] part of the [c]ity’s current general plan.”\n(Id. at p. 146.) The Supreme Court ruled it was not, in light of the voters’\nrejection of the more recent general plan amendment in the referendum\nelection. (Id. at pp. 156–157, 160.) In that very different context, Orange\nCitizens stated the sentence relied on by Move Eden: “If ‘legislative bodies\ncannot nullify [the referendum] power by voting to enact a law identical to a\nrecently rejected referendum measure,’ then the City [of Orange] cannot now\ndo the same by means of an unreasonable ‘administrative correction’ to its\ngeneral plan undertaken ‘ “with intent to evade the effect of the referendum\npetition.” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 146, 150, 160.) But the Supreme Court did not apply\nsection 9241, and the decision does not support Move Eden’s argument that\nthe City was prohibited from taking valid administrative actions to\nimplement long-approved legislative determinations no longer challengeable\nby referendum. (Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2024) 17 Cal.5th 1, 39\n[“ ‘It is axiomatic . . . that a decision does not stand for a proposition not\nconsidered by the court’ ”].)\n      We also observe that, in applying the “essentially the same” test, the\nRubalcava and Lindelli courts addressed legislative acts in both the original\nand subsequent enactments, and the issue was whether the subsequent\nenactments retained the essence of the legislative acts the voters objected to.\n(Rubalcava, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 578; Lindelli, supra, 111\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1111–1112; see also Rubalcava, at pp. 574–578\n[summarizing other cases].) In that context, it was appropriate to focus on\n“the objectionable features of the initial ordinances.” (Rubalcava, at p. 578;\nsee also Lindelli, at p. 1111.) But because the only legislative acts in the\n2022 Resolution were approval of the Veterans Park provisions, and because\nthe 2024 Resolution contains no legislative acts, the present case is\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\ffundamentally different than those cases. For purposes of applying the\nsection 9241 stay, it is of no moment that the supporters of the referendum\nhere may have been motivated by opposition to the Project as a whole,\nbecause the legislative determinations underlying the Project as a whole\n(excepting Veterans Park) were not subject to challenge by referendum.\n      In conclusion, we construe “ordinance” as used in the phrase “the\nordinance shall not again be enacted by the legislative body for a period of\none year” (§ 9241) to refer to a subsequent enactment that is “essentially the\nsame” with respect to a legislative act or acts that made the original\nenactment subject to the referendum power in the first place. A subsequent\nenactment violates section 9241 if, during the stay period, it readopts one or\nmore legislative decisions in an identical or insufficiently modified form (as in\nLindelli, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th 1099). But section 9241 does not prohibit a\ncity from readopting administrative acts that do not have the effect of\nundermining the stay as to any legislative act in the original enactment. 17\n      By giving full effect to the voters’ ability to challenge approval of\nVeterans Park—the only legislative act in the 2022 Resolution—this court\ncomplies with its duty to “ ‘jealously guard’ ” and “ ‘liberal[ly]’ ” construe the\nreferendum power. (Associated Home Builders, supra, 18 Cal.3d at p. 591;\nsee also County of Kern, supra, 46 Cal.App.5th at p. 101 [stating that\n“vigilant protection” does not “equate [to] . . . expanding the referendum\npower so it restricts legislative bodies” beyond the degree mandated by the\n\n\n\n      17 Move Eden argues the City may not ultimately be able to proceed\n\nwith the Project without Veterans Park. We need not address that assertion\nbecause it does not inform our construction of section 9241. That is, even if\nthe Project cannot proceed to completion without the park, that does not\nchange the fact that the 2024 Resolution is outside the scope of the\nreferendum power.\n\n                                        27\n\fconstitution].) Move Eden offers no reason why the City was prohibited from\ntaking administrative acts necessary to implement legislative policies that\nhad been adopted long before the 2022 Resolution, and Move Eden offers no\nreason why such a result would be consistent with the constitutional\nreferendum power. Extending section 9241 to reach the 2024 Resolution’s\nadministrative acts would not protect the referendum power; instead, it\nwould permit Move Eden to improperly obstruct the Project as a whole.

(Move Eden). The proposed\nreferendum challenged a 2022 city council resolution (the 2022 Resolution)\napproving a development agreement between the City and real party in\ninterest Eden Housing, Inc. (Eden Housing) for development of affordable\nworkforce housing in downtown Livermore. Among other things, this court\nheld that, although the 2022 Resolution largely involved administrative acts\nnot subject to the referendum power, adoption of the resolution was a\nlegislative act because, for the first time, it authorized the construction of and\n\n\n\n\n                                        1\n\fimprovements to a new public park, to be called Veterans Park. 1 (Move Eden\nI, at pp. 269, 275–278.)\n      Following the decision in Move Eden I, the City repealed the 2022\nResolution and enacted a new resolution (the 2024 Resolution) that approves\nthe same agreement approved in the 2022 Resolution, except it omits the\nprovisions related to the construction of Veterans Park that were central to\nthis court’s decision in Move Eden I. Move Eden moved for an order\ncompelling the City to comply with the writ of mandate, arguing that\nadoption of the 2024 Resolution violated section 9241 of the Elections Code, 2\nwhich provides that an ordinance not submitted to the voters must be\n“entirely repeal[ed]” and prohibits reenactment of a repealed ordinance “for a\nperiod of one year after the date of its repeal by the legislative body.” The\ntrial court granted the motion.\n      We reverse. Consistent with the scope of the referendum power, we\nconclude that section 9241 did not prohibit the City from adopting the 2024\nResolution, which involves only administrative acts implementing prior\nlegislative determinations not challengeable by referendum.\n                               BACKGROUND 3\n      The present appeal involves a proposed residential development in\ndowntown Livermore (the Project), at the location of a former supermarket,\nin an area bounded by Railroad Avenue, Livermore Avenue, First Street, and\n\n\n      1 The 2022 Resolution referred to the park as Veteran’s Park and the\n\nsubsequent enactment at issue in the present appeal refers to Veterans Park;\nwe use the more recent spelling herein.\n\n      2 All undesignated section references are to the Elections Code.\n\n\n      3 Aside from the post-remand developments, this background is drawn\n\nfrom this court’s prior decision, Move Eden I, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">100 Cal.App.5th 263</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                       2\n\fL Street (the Property).

The funds were awarded to the\nCity for “site acquisition and pre-development expenses” in the City’s\ndowntown. The City loaned the funds to the former redevelopment agency,\nand a deed restriction was recorded requiring any development of the\nProperty to include “at least” 28 units of “low-income” housing and 56 units of\n“moderate-income” housing.\n      In 2018, the City and Eden Housing entered into a Disposition and\nDevelopment and Loan Agreement for development of the Property (2018\nAgreement). The 2018 Agreement recited that, in January, the city council\n“approved the development of the Livermore Village Site[4] to include a public\npark, up to 130 units of workforce housing, a science center, a black box\ntheater, and retail space.” The City selected Eden Housing to develop\nhousing at the Property, and the agreement states a portion of the Property\n“will be dedicated to the City for a park.” The City agreed, after satisfaction\nof various conditions, to sell the Property to Eden Housing for the Property’s\nfair market value at the time of sale and to make “a future acquisition loan to\n[Eden Housing] in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Property.”\n      In December 2020, the City reviewed “Conceptual Plans” and\n“instructed staff to move forward” (capitalization omitted) with the Project.\n\n\n      4 The Livermore Village Site is a larger area that includes the Property.\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fIn May 2021, the City approved land use entitlements for the Project, subject\nto conditions. That same month, the City approved an amended development\nagreement (2021 Agreement). The approval resolution and the 2021\nAgreement recited that the City and Eden Housing “wish to amend the [2018\nAgreement] to clarify the definition of the Property subject to transfer by City\nfor development of the Project, define development and financial obligations\nfor [Veterans] Park” and other matters. With respect to the park, the 2021\nAgreement stated, “[a]t City’s option, City and Developer may negotiate a\nfuture construction and reimbursement agreement with Developer to\ncoordinate the construction of the [Veterans] Park Improvements. These\nimprovements would be exclusive of any development loan provided by the\nCity for development of the Project.”\n      In June 2021, a group known as Save Livermore Downtown filed a\npetition for a writ of mandate contending that the City violated the California\nEnvironmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) and state\nand local planning and zoning laws in approving the Project. The trial court\ndenied the petition and this court affirmed. (Save Livermore Downtown,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">87 Cal.App.5th 1116</span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n      On May 24, 2022, the City adopted the 2022 Resolution, Resolution No.\n2022-085, which was the subject of Move Eden I. The 2022 Resolution\nauthorized the execution of an “Amended and Restated Disposition,\nDevelopment and Loan Agreement” for the Project (2022 Agreement). Among\nother provisions, the 2022 Agreement reflects the City’s decision to spend\n$5.5 million on constructing and improving Veterans Park as part of the\nProject. In particular, the agreement provides, “The Parties agree that the\nDeveloper will manage the construction of the [Veterans] Park Improvements\nbut that the City will pay for the costs of the [Veterans] Park Improvements\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fat its sole expense. City and Developer will negotiate a future construction\nmanagement and reimbursement agreement to coordinate the construction of\nthe [Veterans] Park Improvements. The Agreement shall authorize\nreimbursement for the construction of the park, per the designs and\nspecifications issued by the City, and shall not exceed [$5.5 million] . . .\nwithout additional approval of the City Council.”\n      On May 27, 2022, the City Clerk was provided a proposed summary of\nthe 2022 Resolution for the purpose of a proposed referendum on the\nresolution. On June 3, Move Eden was formed to, among other things,\npromote the qualification of the proposed referendum. On July 8, the\nreferendum proponents submitted a referendum petition to the City Clerk\nwith more than the required number of signatures to qualify the referendum\nfor the November 2022 ballot.\n      On July 13, 2022, the City Clerk stated in a letter that, “[b]ased on the\nadvice from the City Attorney and special counsel, . . . the City has\ndetermined that Resolution No. 2022-085 was an administrative act, not a\nlegislative act, and not subject to referendum.”\n      In August 2022, Move Eden filed a petition for writ of mandate\n(Petition) seeking to compel the City and the City Clerk to process the\nreferendum petition in accordance with the Elections Code.\n      In January 2023, the trial court denied the Petition on the merits. The\ncourt concluded the 2022 Resolution was not subject to challenge by\nreferendum because it was an administrative act or, in the alternative,\nbecause the City acted as an administrative agent of the state in adopting it.\nThe court concluded that either it was lawful for the City Clerk to refuse to\nprocess the referendum petition, or it is proper to “ ‘retroactively validate[]’ ”\nthe conclusion that the proposed referendum is invalid, even if the City Clerk\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fviolated the law. The trial court denied the Petition, and the appeal resulting\nin Move Eden I followed.\n      In Move Eden I, this court reversed, concluding that the City Clerk\ncould not refuse to process the referendum based on advice from the City that\nthe 2022 Resolution was an administrative act, and that the City did not act\nas an administrative agent of the state in adopting the resolution. (Move\nEden I, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at pp. 273–276, 278–284.) This court further\nheld that adoption of the 2022 Resolution was a legislative act subject to\nchallenge by referendum because “[t]he 2022 Agreement, for the first time,\nauthorizes the construction of and improvements to [Veterans] Park.” (Id. at\np. 277.) 5 Finally, in an unpublished portion of the decision, this court held\nthe City did not act legislatively in approving loan terms and an indemnity\nprovision relating to hazardous waste in the 2022 Resolution. We remanded\nto the trial court with directions “to issue a peremptory writ of mandate\nordering [the City Clerk and the City] to process the referendum petition as\nrequired by the Elections Code.” (Move Eden I, at p. 286.) 6\n      On remand, the trial court issued a writ of mandate compelling the\nCity to process Move Eden’s referendum petition “as required by the\nElections Code.” The City Clerk processed the referendum petition by\ndelivering it to the Alameda County Registrar of Voters. After the\nreferendum was certified, it was presented to the city council for a decision\n\n\n      5 In its opening brief, the City presents information and arguments\n\nregarding the status of Veterans Park prior to adoption of the 2022\nResolution; those matters were not presented to this court in the Move Eden I\nappeal, and the City identifies no relevance to the issues in the present\nappeal. (See Move Eden I, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at p. 277.)\n\n      6 We also reversed the trial court’s order requiring Move Eden to file an\n\nundertaking under Code of Civil Procedure section 529.2.\n\n                                        6\n\fwhether to repeal the 2022 Resolution or to place it on a ballot for voter\napproval. On June 24, 2024, the city council repealed the 2022 Resolution in\nResolution No. 2024-108, reciting that the City “respects the Appellate\nCourt’s opinion that the approval of the construction of and improvements to\nVeterans Park is a legislative act, and the will of the voters to set aside that\nact, and hereby repeals” the 2022 Resolution. Separately but on the same\nday, the city council adopted the 2024 Resolution, Resolution No. 2024-109,\nwhich reaffirms the 2022 Agreement, except for all provisions pertaining to\nthe construction of and improvements to Veterans Park. The 2024\nResolution states that the City “ratifies, reaffirms, and readopts the [City’s]\nexecution of the [2022 Agreement], except for the language for the\nconstruction of and improvement to Veterans [P]ark, and hereby\nacknowledges that the remaining language of the agreement remains in full\nforce and effect as of the date the agreement was signed.” The 2024\nResolution included, as exhibits, the 2022 Resolution with the original 2022\nAgreement and a document indicating the provisions in the agreement\nrelating to Veterans Park that have been “pulled from the agreement.” 7\n      Move Eden moved for an order compelling compliance with the writ of\nmandate, arguing adoption of the 2024 Resolution violated section 9241. The\ntrial court granted the motion, finding that “the new 2024 resolution was\nsubstantially similar to the original one, with the exclusion of the Veterans\nPark provisions, and not ‘essentially different,’ ” and concluding that the City\nviolated section 9241 because the City “effectively repealed only part of the\noriginal resolution” and because “the new resolution cannot be enacted for a\nperiod of a year following the repeal.”\n\n\n      7 The City actually took all these steps to comply with the Move Eden I\n\ndecision before the trial court issued its writ of mandate in July 2024.\n\n                                          7\n\f      The present appeal followed.\n                                 DISCUSSION\nI.

The City Did Not Violate Section 9241\n       The trial court concluded the City failed to comply with the writ of\nmandate because it did not, in effect, “entirely repeal” the 2022 Resolution\nwithin the meaning of section 9241, and because adoption of the 2024\nResolution violated section 9241’s one-year stay provision. Both arguments\nturn on the proper construction of section 9241.\n       It is important to make several observations at the outset. The\nunderlying 2022 Agreement is an expansive agreement covering a wide range\nof issues related to construction of the Project, an affordable workforce\nhousing development in the City’s downtown. In Move Eden I, supra, 100\nCal.App.5th at page 277, this court held that only one aspect of the\nagreement involved legislative determinations—to wit, “The 2022 Agreement,\nfor the first time, authorizes the construction of and improvements to\n[Veterans] Park” as part of the Project. That determination meant that\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\fadoption of the 2022 Resolution, which approved the 2022 Agreement, was a\nlegislative act subject to challenge by referendum. (Id. at pp. 275–278.) But\nwe were clear, in an unpublished portion of the opinion, that that did not\nmean that approval of the remaining aspects of the 2022 Agreement was\nlegislative, pointing out that Move Eden had cited “no authority that or\nreasoning why a determination that is otherwise administrative may be\ntreated as legislative because the provision at issue is part of a larger\nagreement, the approval of which is legislative due to a wholly unrelated\nprovision.” In the present appeal, Move Eden emphasizes that the 2024\nResolution approves virtually the same underlying agreement as the 2022\nResolution, with only the Veterans Park provisions removed. But Move Eden\ndoes not dispute that the remaining aspects of the agreement involve only\nadministrative determinations and that those determinations implement\nlegislative decisions made long before the 2022 Resolution and never\nchallenged by referendum. 9 And Move Eden does not dispute that the\nreferendum power applies only to legislative acts, and it does not suggest that\nthe 2024 Resolution, which involves only administrative acts, is\n\n\n\n\n      9 Move Eden argued in the previous appeal that approval of loan terms\n\nand an indemnification provision in the 2022 Agreement was legislative, but\nour rejection of that contention in the unpublished portion of Move Eden I is\nnow law of the case. (People v. Boyer (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515839/people-v-boyer/#441\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v. Boyer\">38 Cal.4th 412, 441</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Move Eden\nrelies on a footnote in the same unpublished portion of Move Eden I to argue\nthat the law of the case doctrine somehow precludes the City’s argument that\nthe trial court erred in applying section 9241 to the 2024 Resolution. Move\nEden’s argument is misplaced because we did not address section 9241 in\nMove Eden I. In the footnote at issue, we addressed only the City’s new\nrequest at oral argument that it be permitted to proceed with a referendum\non only the Veterans Park provisions, and we observed only that the City\nfailed to provide authority supporting the request.\n\n                                       13\n\findependently subject to challenge by referendum. These considerations are\ncritical to our application of section 9241 in the present case.\n      A.     The 2022 Resolution Was “Entirely Repealed”\n      Section 9241 provides that, “[i]f the legislative body does not entirely\nrepeal the ordinance against which the petition is filed, the legislative body\nshall submit the ordinance to the voters . . . .” It is undisputed that the City\ndid, literally, “entirely repeal” the 2022 Resolution. But the trial court\nconcluded the City did not repeal the resolution within the meaning of section\n9241 because the City also adopted the 2024 Resolution, which reaffirmed the\n2022 Agreement except for the provisions relating to Veterans Park. The\ntrial court erred. 10\n      Move Eden relies on the decision in County of Kern v.

There, the Kern County Board of\nSupervisors adopted an ordinance banning medical marijuana dispensaries.\n(Id. at p. 310.) After voters challenged the ordinance through a referendum\npetition, the county opted to repeal not only the ordinance, but the entire\nsection of the county’s ordinance code addressing medical marijuana\ndispensaries, resulting in a de facto ban. (Id. at p. 312.) In considering\nwhether the ordinance had been entirely repealed, 11 the court reasoned that\n\n\n      10 We have reviewed the legislative history to the 1911 enactment\n\n(Stats. 1911, ch. 33) that added the “entirely repeal” language now in section\n9241 (see fn. 8, ante), but we found nothing helpful to resolving the issues in\nthe present appeal.\n\n      11 TCEF applied section 9145, which governs the referendum process\n\nfor counties. Like section 9241, section 9145 uses the phrase “entirely\nrepeal.” “Section 9241 is more detailed than section 9145 because it includes\na sentence that the ordinance repealed by the board and rejected by the\nvoters ‘shall not again be enacted by the legislative body for a period of one\nyear.’ ” (TCEF, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3191647\"><a href=\"/opinion/3191744/county-of-kern-v-tcef-inc/#321\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: County of Kern v.

From that perspective, to “entirely repeal” an ordinance, an\nagency must “(1) revoke the protested ordinance in all its parts and (2)\nrefrain from additional action that has the practical effect of implementing\nthe essential feature of the protested ordinance.” (Id. at p. 323.) In TCEF,\nbecause the county’s repeal of the prior code sections had the “practical effect\nof implementing the essential feature of the protested ordinance—namely, a\nban on dispensaries,” the county did not entirely repeal the ordinance. (Id. at\npp. 324–325.)\n      Here, the City “revoke[d] [the 2022 Resolution] in all its parts.” (TCEF,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3191647\"><a href=\"/opinion/3191744/county-of-kern-v-tcef-inc/#323\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: County of Kern v. T.C.E.F., Inc.\">246 Cal.App.4th at p. 323</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) The trial court so acknowledged, observing\nthat the City adopted “a new resolution that repealed Resolution [No.] 2022-\n085” and the “parties all agree that these steps were consistent with, and\nwould satisfy, the writ of mandate.” Move Eden argues adoption of the 2024\nResolution rendered the repeal ineffective as to most aspects of the 2022\nAgreement, but that is relevant to the second, “practical effect” aspect of the\nTCEF test, not to the question of whether the resolution was fully revoked.\n      In applying that second aspect, the critical task is identifying “the\nessential feature of the protested ordinance.” (TCEF, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3191647\"><a href=\"/opinion/3191744/county-of-kern-v-tcef-inc/#323\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: County of Kern v. T.C.E.F., Inc.\">246 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 323</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) We conclude that the only reasonable understanding of “essential\nfeature” is that, at a minimum, it must include a legislative act that made the\nprior ordinance subject to challenge by referendum in the first place. To\nconclude otherwise ignores that the entire rationale for the TCEF decision\nwas protection of the referendum power, which only reaches legislative acts.\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fAs the court explained, “it is reasonable to regard the protest petition as a\nchallenge or legislative check aimed at the essential (i.e., important,\nprincipal) subject matter of the protested ordinance—the ban on medical\nmarijuana dispensaries. We adopt a relatively narrow legal test as that test\nis sufficient to deal with the facts of this case, while serving the statutory\npurpose of protecting the referendum power.” (Id. at p. 322; see also id. at p.\n325 [“Allowing County to achieve the practical equivalent of a dispensary ban\nby alternate means would render section 9145’s protections of the referendum\npower so ineffectual that the referendum process would no longer\n‘guarantee[] to the citizens an ultimate check on legislative power’ ”].)\n      It is critical to understand that TCEF involved unusual circumstances\nin which a legislative body was able to achieve the same legislative objective\nas a prior enactment by a subsequent enactment that was not substantially\nsimilar to the original enactment. (See TCEF, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3191647\"><a href=\"/opinion/3191744/county-of-kern-v-tcef-inc/#325\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: County of Kern v.

Where a legislative body repeals a\nchallenged ordinance but then takes another, different action that\nundermines the repeal of the prior legislative act, the legislative body\neffectively interferes with the referendum power. Here, the trial court\nconcluded it was “too clever by half to say that the City ‘entirely repealed’ the\noriginal resolution when it immediately substituted almost all of the original\nlanguage in the replacement resolution.” But we understand the purpose of\nsection 9241 differently. Because the administrative acts in the 2022\nResolution were not an essential feature of the resolution for purposes of\nsection 9241, and because the 2024 Resolution does not have the “practical\neffect” of undermining repeal of the Veterans Park provisions (the only\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\flegislative aspect of the prior enactment), the trial court improperly extended\nthe referendum power to reach purely administrative acts when it concluded\nthe City failed to entirely repeal the 2022 Resolution due to adoption of the\n2024 Resolution. 12\n      Finally, although Move Eden provides no reason why administrative\nacts not subject to the referendum power can be considered an “essential\nfeature” of an ordinance for purposes of section 9241, Move Eden focuses on\nlanguage in the 2024 Resolution that purports to leave undisturbed all parts\nof the 2022 Agreement other than the Veterans Park provisions. In\nparticular, the 2024 Resolution states, the “remaining language of the [2022]\n[A]greement remains in full force and effect as of the date the agreement was\nsigned.” But, although that language undermines the practical effect of\nrepeal of the 2022 Resolution as to the administrative acts therein, nothing in\nthe 2024 Resolution undermines the repeal of the Veterans Park provisions,\nwhich are the only essential features of the 2022 Resolution for purposes of\nsection 9241.\n      The trial court erred in concluding the City failed to “entirely repeal”\nthe 2022 Resolution within the meaning of section 9241.\n      B.    The 2024 Resolution Did Not Violate the Section 9241 Stay\n      In the alternative, Move Eden contends that adoption of the 2024\nResolution violated the portion of section 9241 providing that “the ordinance\nshall not again be enacted by the legislative body for a period of one year\n\n\n\n      12 See also the discussion below (Part III.B., post) regarding\n\ninterpretation of the section 9241 stay provision. The reasons for concluding\nthat provision did not prohibit the 2024 Resolution—respecting the scope of\nthe referendum power, preserving the ability of government to function, and\nproviding a principled basis for decisionmaking—are equally applicable to\nconstruing the section 9241 repeal provision.\n\n                                       17\n\fafter the date of its repeal by the legislative body or disapproval by the\nvoters.” We reject the contention.\n      “The function of the stay provision is to enforce the electorate’s power\nto approve or reject measures provisionally adopted by a legislative body\nbefore they take effect. If the stay provision were interpreted to apply only to\nthe specific measure challenged by referendum, the referendum power could\nbe ‘completely nullified.’ [Citation.] ‘[T]he legislative body could by merely\namending [the challenged ordinance] in a minor way and adding additional\nmatters, then adopt in its entirety the legislative act objected to in the\nreferendum petition. If such were the law, the council merely by continuous\namendment of that act could deprive the voters of ever having an act either\nrepealed or brought to a vote.’ [Citation.] For this reason, the stay is not\nconfined to the specific ordinance and its exact terms. It extends to repassage\nof the challenged ordinance with minor amendments. This rule is ‘inherent\nin the very principle of the referendum and the spirit of the section.’\n[Citation.] ‘If such were not the case, no referendum could ever be brought to\na conclusion, because a council could prevent it by recurrent amendments to\nthe disputed legislative act.’ ” (</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271130/lindelli-v-town-of-san-anselmo/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Lindelli v.

It does not prevent a legislative body or a city council from adopting\nany [and all] measures involving the same subject matter. In determining\nwhether a subsequently enacted ordinance violates the [section 9241] stay\n. . . , we ask ‘whether the second legislative enactment is essentially the same\nas the first.’ ” (Lindelli, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271130/lindelli-v-town-of-san-anselmo/#1110\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Lindelli v.

This\nrule is “an implied element of the constitutional provisions reserving the\nreferendum power.” (Rubalcava, at p. 573.)\n      In Lindelli, the Town of San Anselmo awarded a waste management\nfranchise to a new provider in place of the incumbent; after opponents\nqualified a referendum on the franchise, the town accepted bids for an\ninterim contract and then awarded the new provider the interim contract\nuntil the referendum election.

Because “the\ninterim contract differ[ed] from the original franchise only in the length of\ntime covered,” its adoption violated section 9241. (Lindelli, at p. 1111; see\nalso Martin v.

However, the critical difference\nbetween the present case and Lindelli is that, in Lindelli, the service provider\nchanges (in both the original and the subsequent enactment) were\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f“legislative” decisions “subject to the referendum process.” 13 (Lindelli, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271130/lindelli-v-town-of-san-anselmo/#1113\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Lindelli v.

In the present case, the determination to move\nforward with the Project as a whole (but without Veterans Park) was not\nsubject to challenge by referendum, and the 2024 Resolution contains no\nlegislative acts.

Ashley (1949) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2617871\"><a href=\"/opinion/2617871/gilbert-v-ashley/#415\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Gilbert v.

There, the\nsubsequent ordinance was not subject to referendum under an exception for\ntax levies for the usual current expenses of a city (id. at p. 415), so the court\ndid not address the legislative-administrative dichotomy. And, although the\ncourt observed that the enactments were materially different (ibid.), the\ncourt had no occasion to consider whether the essential aspects of an\nordinance are the legislative acts that made the original ordinance subject to\nthe referendum power.\n\n                                       21\n\foriginal enactment that made the enactment subject to the referendum\npower. Several principles lead us to conclude this is the most reasonable\ninterpretation of section 9241.\n      First, section 9241 is part of the referendum process and it must be\nconstrued accordingly. Just as “[t]he Elections Code . . . may be reasonably\ninterpreted as providing for the use of referendum only with respect to such\nordinances as are constitutionally subject to referendum” (Geiger v. Board of\nSupervisors (1957) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455211/geiger-v-board-of-supervisors/#839\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Geiger v.

(See also People v. Superior Court\n(Zamudio) (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9541574\"><a href=\"/opinion/1159607/people-v-superior-court-zamudio/#193\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

As noted previously, it is well-\nestablished that the referendum power extends only to enactments that are\nan exercise of a governing body’s legislative powers. (Dunkl, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2304729\"><a href=\"/opinion/2304729/city-of-san-diego-v-dunkl/#399\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: City of San Diego v.

Thus, construing the section 9241 stay to prohibit only enactments that\nreadopt a legislative aspect of a challenged ordinance (either expressly or\neffectively) is consistent with the reach of the referendum power. In contrast,\nMove Eden’s construction of section 9241 would be an unprecedented\nextension of the referendum power to prohibit entirely administrative acts.\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\f      Second, Move Eden’s interpretation of section 9241 would undermine\nessential government functions for no purpose consistent with the\nreferendum power. As the Supreme Court observed in construing the scope\nof a provision exempting tax levies from referendum, “[i]f essential\ngovernmental functions would be seriously impaired by the referendum\nprocess, the courts, in construing the applicable constitutional and statutory\nprovisions, will assume that no such result was intended.” (Geiger, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455211/geiger-v-board-of-supervisors/#839\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Geiger v. Board of Supervisors\">48\nCal.2d at p. 839</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; accord, Wilde, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1123.) In the present\ncase, it is undisputed that the legislative decisions about the Project that are\nimplemented by the administrative provisions in both the 2022 and 2024\nResolutions were made long before adoption of the 2022 Resolution and were\nnot challenged by referendum. Although the referendum challenging the\n2022 Resolution had the effect of delaying the administrative acts in the\nresolution as well as the new legislative approval of Veterans Park, the\nreferendum power does not justify Move Eden’s effort to frustrate the City’s\nability to take administrative actions to move forward with previously\napproved aspects of the Project following repeal of the 2022 Resolution.\n      “California has a housing supply and affordability crisis of historic\nproportions.” (Gov. Code, § 65589.5, subd. (a)(2)(A); see also California\nRenters Legal Advocacy &amp; Education Fund v. City of San Mateo (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">68\nCal.App.5th 820</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830; Anderson v. City of San Jose (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 Cal.App.5th\n683</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705–712.) As Eden Housing points out and Move Eden does not dispute,\ndelays in construction projects can be very costly and, in some circumstances,\ncan threaten the viability of a project. (See, e.g., Note, Addressing Challenges\nto Affordable Housing in Land Use Law: Recognizing Affordable Housing as a\nRight (2022) 135 Harv. L.Rev. 1104, 1113, fn. 70 [“some have observed that\nwhen it comes to authorizing development, ‘delay is as good as denial,’\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\f[citation], and opponents of affordable housing have actively pursued delay as\na method of preventing development, [citation]. In addition to the costs of\nfighting for authorization, delay creates a risk of rising construction costs and\nchanged market conditions.”].) The City’s compliance with this court’s\ndecision in Move Eden I by eliminating from the 2024 Resolution the sole\nlegislative determination in the 2022 Resolution is sufficient to protect the\nreferendum power. Move Eden’s construction of section 9241 would allow the\nreferendum power “ ‘to be invoked to annul or delay . . . administrative\nconduct’ ” and “ ‘would destroy the efficient administration of the business\naffairs of’ ” the City as to a long-planned affordable workforce housing\ndevelopment, for no purpose consistent with the referendum power.

It would be unreasonable to\nconclude that was the intent behind section 9241. 16\n      Finally, Move Eden’s construction of section 9241, focusing on the\nquantitative similarities between the 2022 and 2024 Resolutions as a whole,\nfails to provide a principled basis for decisionmaking. Under its approach,\n\n\n\n      16 To be clear, we need not and do not rely on a “broad proposition that\n\nthe powers of direct democracy are not to be interpreted to defeat essential\ngovernment functions.” (Wilde, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1124, fn. 9.) As we\nhave explained, the 2024 Resolution is outside the scope of the referendum\npower, so our holding does not impinge on the constitutional powers of direct\ndemocracy. Nevertheless, that Move Eden’s construction of section 9241\nwould disrupt essential government functions for no purpose consistent with\nthe referendum power is a relevant consideration in determining whether the\nLegislature intended to prohibit enactments like the 2024 Resolution.\n\n                                       24\n\fwhat percentage of a resolution must be changed in order to avoid a\ndetermination that a subsequent enactment is “essentially the same”? Could\nthe City have enacted a resolution that only readopted the Veterans Park\nprovisions? Such a narrow enactment would not be similar in scope or\ncontent to the expansive 2022 Resolution, but it would be absurd to conclude\nthe City could readopt the single legislative determination that made the\noriginal resolution subject to the referendum power. In contrast, our\nconstruction of section 9241 provides a bright line for decisionmaking by\nmaking it clear that the focus must be on whether the subsequent enactment\neffectuates a legislative act in the repealed enactment. (See People v.\nCoronado (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9533483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127458/people-v-coronado/#151\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: People v.

Superior Court (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4107680\"><a href=\"/opinion/4330419/orange-citizens-for-parks-recreation-v-superior-court-of-orange-cnty/#160\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Orange Citizens for Parks &amp; Recreation v. Superior Court...\">2\nCal.5th 141, 160</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But the Court there addressed an entirely different issue.\nIn Orange Citizens, the City of Orange amended its general plan to permit\nthe development of residential housing in an area previously designated for a\ngolf course or open space. (Id. at pp. 146–150.) When a group of citizens\nqualified a referendum to challenge the amendment, the city took the\nposition that (1) a 1973 resolution that was adopted but never implemented\nthrough changes to the city’s maps permitted residential housing in the\ndesignated area; and (2) the referendum was, therefore, irrelevant since the\nchallenged recent amendment “was not required to permit” the development.\n(Id. at pp. 147, 150.) The main question addressed by Orange Citizens was\n\n\n\n                                      25\n\f“whether the 1973 resolution [was] part of the [c]ity’s current general plan.”\n(Id. at p. 146.) The Supreme Court ruled it was not, in light of the voters’\nrejection of the more recent general plan amendment in the referendum\nelection. (Id. at pp. 156–157, 160.) In that very different context, Orange\nCitizens stated the sentence relied on by Move Eden: “If ‘legislative bodies\ncannot nullify [the referendum] power by voting to enact a law identical to a\nrecently rejected referendum measure,’ then the City [of Orange] cannot now\ndo the same by means of an unreasonable ‘administrative correction’ to its\ngeneral plan undertaken ‘ “with intent to evade the effect of the referendum\npetition.” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 146, 150, 160.) But the Supreme Court did not apply\nsection 9241, and the decision does not support Move Eden’s argument that\nthe City was prohibited from taking valid administrative actions to\nimplement long-approved legislative determinations no longer challengeable\nby referendum. (Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2024) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal.5th 1</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39\n[“ ‘It is axiomatic . . . that a decision does not stand for a proposition not\nconsidered by the court’ ”].)\n      We also observe that, in applying the “essentially the same” test, the\nRubalcava and Lindelli courts addressed legislative acts in both the original\nand subsequent enactments, and the issue was whether the subsequent\nenactments retained the essence of the legislative acts the voters objected to.\n(Rubalcava, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244850\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244850/rubalcava-v-martinez/#578\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Rubalcava v.

In that context, it was appropriate to focus on\n“the objectionable features of the initial ordinances.” (Rubalcava, at p. 578;\nsee also Lindelli, at p. 1111.) But because the only legislative acts in the\n2022 Resolution were approval of the Veterans Park provisions, and because\nthe 2024 Resolution contains no legislative acts, the present case is\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\ffundamentally different than those cases. For purposes of applying the\nsection 9241 stay, it is of no moment that the supporters of the referendum\nhere may have been motivated by opposition to the Project as a whole,\nbecause the legislative determinations underlying the Project as a whole\n(excepting Veterans Park) were not subject to challenge by referendum.\n      In conclusion, we construe “ordinance” as used in the phrase “the\nordinance shall not again be enacted by the legislative body for a period of\none year” (§ 9241) to refer to a subsequent enactment that is “essentially the\nsame” with respect to a legislative act or acts that made the original\nenactment subject to the referendum power in the first place. A subsequent\nenactment violates section 9241 if, during the stay period, it readopts one or\nmore legislative decisions in an identical or insufficiently modified form (as in\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271130/lindelli-v-town-of-san-anselmo/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Lindelli v.

But section 9241 does not prohibit a\ncity from readopting administrative acts that do not have the effect of\nundermining the stay as to any legislative act in the original enactment. 17\n      By giving full effect to the voters’ ability to challenge approval of\nVeterans Park—the only legislative act in the 2022 Resolution—this court\ncomplies with its duty to “ ‘jealously guard’ ” and “ ‘liberal[ly]’ ” construe the\nreferendum power.

Move Eden offers no reason why the City was prohibited from\ntaking administrative acts necessary to implement legislative policies that\nhad been adopted long before the 2022 Resolution, and Move Eden offers no\nreason why such a result would be consistent with the constitutional\nreferendum power.
