Anthony, J.</p>\n<p>      Maureen E. Booth (Melanie D. Foxx also present) for the husband.</p>\n<p>      Marcus L. Scott for the wife.</p>\n<p>      SHIN, J.  A judge of the Probate and Family Court issued a second amended judgment of divorce nisi in which she deviated from the presumptive durational limit on alimony set out in G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b), and ordered the former husband (husband) to pay alimony to the former wife (wife) potentially for the remainder of the wife's life.  The husband appeals, arguing that the evidence did not support the judge's decision to deviate.  He further challenges the amount of the alimony award (and, relatedly, the amount of child support that the judge ordered the wife to pay to the husband) and the division of the marital estate.[1]  With respect to the duration of the husband's alimony payments, we agree that the judge should not have deviated from the presumptive limit because the wife failed to meet her burden of showing that the asserted ground for deviation, her mental health condition and resulting inability to work, is reasonably likely to persist beyond the presumptive termination date.  We therefore vacate the portion of the second amended judgment relating to the duration of the alimony award, without prejudice to the wife's renewing her request for deviation through a future complaint for modification.  As we are unpersuaded by the husband's remaining arguments, we affirm the second amended judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p>      Background.  The parties were married in India on October 25, 2009.  Their first child was born in February 2014.  Their second child, who was delivered in September 2020, was stillborn.  Both parties are highly educated.  The husband obtained a Ph.D. in 2004 and has worked continuously at a university in Boston since that time.  The wife obtained a master's degree in urban health in 2018 and worked at times during the marriage as a dental assistant.</p>\n<p>      The husband filed a complaint for divorce on May 20, 2021, on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  Trial was held on January 10, 2023.  Only two witnesses testified:  the husband, and the special master appointed to sell the former marital home.  The judge admitted several exhibits in evidence, including a report of the guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed to evaluate the issues of custody and a parenting plan for the parties' child.  The judge also accepted a stipulation of uncontested facts submitted by the parties.</p>\n<p>      The evidence regarding the wife's mental health condition, which was a key factor in the judge's determination of the alimony award, consisted of the GAL's report and the parties' stipulation.  The GAL's report, which the judge credited in full, describes a mental health evaluation that the wife was required to undergo in 2018 in connection with a District Court criminal case.  The doctor who conducted the evaluation, Roger Gray, issued a report in November 2018, diagnosing the wife with delusional disorder, persecutory type.  Dr. Gray noted, however, that schizophrenia could not be ruled out and that \"[t]he future expressions of [the wife's] disorder will most likely clarify the diagnostic question.\"</p>\n<p>      Later in his report, the GAL states that the wife was diagnosed with schizophrenia while visiting India in 2019, but that the evaluator indicated that follow up was necessary, which was not done.  The GAL's report also discusses an evaluation of the wife conducted in 2021 by psychiatrist Timothy Scarella.  During that evaluation the wife acknowledged she was depressed, but denied experiencing paranoia or delusions and claimed that Dr. Gray misdiagnosed her in 2018.  Dr. Scarella reported a working diagnosis of \"[m]ajor [d]epressive disorder, single episode, severe, partial remission.\"  The GAL's report further notes that the wife's therapist reported in 2021 that the wife presented as \"relatively clinically stable,\" did not show any signs of schizophrenia, and was working to manage \"her depressive and anxiety symptoms.\"  Ultimately, the GAL concluded that the wife's \"diagnosis and treatment still need clarification,\" and he recommended the services of a mental health case manager to help the wife develop a treatment plan targeted at her needs.</p>\n<p>      The parties' stipulation of uncontested facts also references the court-ordered evaluation conducted by Dr. Gray.  The parties agreed that Dr. Gray diagnosed the wife with delusional disorder, persecutory type, but could not rule out schizophrenia.  In addition the stipulation states that the parties \"reported to the GAL that she was diagnosed with [s]chizophrenia in India, while on visits there in 2018[2] and took medicine for same, evidence of which was presented to the GAL by the [h]usband.\"  In light of these diagnoses, the parties agreed that the wife's \"mental health is impaired\" and that, \"as a result of the impairment,\" she \"is limited in her ability to work and care for the child.\"</p>\n<p>      Based on these two documents, the judge found that the wife suffers from \"significant mental health issues.\"  In support the judge cited Dr. Gray's diagnosis of delusional disorder, persecutory type, or possible schizophrenia; the parties' report to the GAL that the wife was diagnosed with schizophrenia in India; and their stipulation regarding the wife's mental health impairment and inability to work or care for the child.  The judge also mentioned the opinion of the GAL that the stillbirth of the parties' second child in September 2020 aggravated the wife's mental health issues.</p>\n<p>      These findings then formed the basis of the judge's decision to deviate from the presumptive durational limit on alimony.  The judge determined that the length of the parties' marriage, for purposes of calculating alimony, was 139 months (about eleven and one-half years) and that the presumptive durational limit for marriages of this length would be ninety-seven months (about eight years).  The judge concluded, however, that the interests of justice required deviation because the wife \"suffers from significant mental illness,\" which renders her \"currently unable to engage in employment.\"  While acknowledging that \"the marriage was relatively short in duration,\" the judge reasoned that deviation was still warranted because the wife \"is entirely dependent on [the] [h]usband for her support as a result of her significant mental health issues.\"  The judge accordingly ordered the husband to pay alimony to the wife until either party's death,[3] the wife's remarriage, or further order of the court, whichever is first to occur.</p>\n<p>      Discussion.  1.  Duration of alimony.  Under G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b) (3), \"[i]f the length of the marriage is [fifteen] years or less, but more than [ten] years, general term alimony shall continue for not longer than [seventy] per cent of the number of months of the marriage.\"  A judge may deviate from this durational limit, however, \"upon a written finding . . . that deviation . . . [is] required in the interests of justice.\"  G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).  The husband contends that the interests of justice did not require deviation in this case because, although the parties stipulated that the wife is limited in her ability to work because of her mental illness, the judge had no evidence before her that the wife's condition is permanent.  In these circumstances, the husband says, the judge was obligated to enforce the presumptive limit of ninety-seven months and should have put the burden on the wife to request additional alimony through a complaint for modification if her mental condition is likely to affect her ability to work beyond that time period.  According to the husband, by instead deviating from the presumptive limit in the initial alimony order, the judge improperly put the burden on the husband to seek to terminate his alimony obligation after ninety-seven months, in contravention of the guidelines provided in George v. George, 476 Mass. 65, 69-71 (2016).</p>\n<p>      To the extent the husband is arguing that a complaint for modification is the sole vehicle through which a party may request deviation, we do not read George to stand for that proposition.  In George, 476 Mass. at 69-71, the court set out guidelines for how judges should apply the \"interests of justice\" standard of G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).  At the start of that discussion, the court quoted G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e), which states that \"[i]n setting an initial alimony order, or in modifying an existing order, the court may deviate from duration and amount limits for general term alimony . . . upon written findings that deviation is necessary\" (emphasis added).  George, supra at 69, quoting G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e).  The court then went on to state that \"a judge should evaluate the circumstances of the parties in the here and now, that is, as they exist at the time the deviation is sought, rather than the situation as it existed at the time of divorce.\"  George, supra at 70.  Viewing this statement in context, we do not construe the last clause -- \"rather than the situation as it existed at the time of divorce\" -- to mean that a judge cannot consider a request for deviation at the time of divorce, as that would be irreconcilable with G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e).  Rather, we believe that the court was addressing the specific question of how a judge should evaluate a request for deviation when raised in a modification proceeding.  But when, as here, the request is made in a divorce proceeding, it is consistent with G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e), and procedurally proper, for a judge to consider whether to deviate in setting the initial alimony order.</p>\n<p>      That said, we agree with the husband that the judge's findings do not demonstrate that deviation was warranted.  For marriages such as this one that ended after the effective date of the Alimony Reform Act, St. 2011, c. 124 (act), the presumptive durational limits apply unless the recipient spouse \"prov[es] by a preponderance of the evidence that deviation beyond the presumptive termination date is 'required in the interests of justice.'\"  George, 476 Mass. at 70, quoting G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).  Because a judge deciding a request for deviation must \"evaluate the circumstances of the parties in the here and now,\" George, supra, it follows that, when the request is made in a divorce proceeding, as opposed to a modification proceeding, the recipient spouse has the burden of proving that the interests of justice require deviation at the time of the divorce.  This means in turn that the recipient spouse must prove that the grounds for deviation asserted at the time of the divorce are reasonably likely to be present beyond the presumptive termination date.</p>\n<p>      Here, the judge made no findings about the extent to which the wife's mental illness and resulting inability to work would continue beyond the presumptive termination date.  The act sets forth a nonexhaustive list of \"[g]rounds for deviation,\" including a recipient spouse's \"chronic illness\" or \"unusual health circumstances,\" \"inability to provide for [her] own support by reason of [her] deficiency of property, maintenance or employment opportunity,\" and \"any other factor that the court deems relevant and material.\"  G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e).  While the judge correctly cited these factors, and placed the burden of proof on the wife in accordance with George, in the end the judge found only that the wife proved she is \"currently\" unable to work; the judge did not find that the wife's mental health condition cannot be treated or that it will likely prevent her from working beyond the presumptive durational limit of ninety-seven months.  To the extent such findings are implicit in the judge's decision, they are clearly erroneous because there is no record evidence to support them.  As mentioned, the GAL's report, credited by the judge, states that the wife's \"diagnosis and treatment still need clarification.\"  The GAL further noted that the wife is currently being treated for depression as the primary issue, rather than the issues diagnosed in 2018.  And again, the judge found the wife to be highly educated and that she worked intermittently as a dental assistant during the marriage.</p>\n<p>      In light of the entire record, we agree with the husband that the evidence does not support a finding that the wife's current mental health issues and their effect on her employability would persist beyond ninety-seven months.  Absent such evidence the wife did not meet her burden of proving that the interests of justice require deviation from the presumptive durational limit in the \"here and now,\" that is, at the time of the divorce.  George, 476 Mass. at 70.  The judge thus erred by deviating in the initial alimony order and, by doing so, improperly shifted the burden to the husband to file a complaint for modification to terminate his alimony obligation on the presumptive date.  See id. at 69 (\"for marriages that ended after [the act's effective] date, the recipient spouse will be the moving party[4]\").</p>\n<p>      We stress that nothing we have said precludes the wife from filing a complaint for modification to extend the husband's alimony obligation beyond the presumptive date.  If the wife brings such a case, she will have the burden at that time of proving that deviation is warranted.  See George, 476 Mass. at 70.  In determining whether the wife has met her burden, \"the judge may properly consider the impact the [wife's] disability continues to have on [her] in determining whether deviation beyond the act's durational limits is 'required in the interests of justice.'\"  Id., quoting G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).</p>\n<p>      2.  Amount of alimony and child support.  Under G. L. c. 208, § 53 (b), \"the amount of alimony should generally not exceed the recipient's need or [thirty] to [thirty-five] per cent of the difference between the parties' gross incomes established at the time of the order being issued.\"  After determining the husband's income to be $157,500 and the wife's income to be zero, the judge ordered the husband to pay the wife $984 per week in alimony, equivalent to 32.5 percent of the difference between their incomes.  Then, applying the child support guidelines, the judge ordered the wife to pay the husband $190 per week in child support, resulting in a net weekly obligation to the husband of $794.</p>\n<p>      The husband does not challenge the judge's calculations but raises various arguments why the judge erred by declining to either reduce the alimony award or offset it by deviating upward from the child support guidelines.  At bottom these arguments amount to a claim that the respective support orders result in the husband's bearing a disproportionate share of the financial burden from the divorce, given that he has full custody of the parties' child.[5]  We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p>      A judge has broad discretion in determining the amount of alimony, and we will not reverse an award on appeal unless it is \"plainly wrong\" or \"excessive.\"  D.B. v. J.B., 97 Mass. App. Ct. 170, 177 (2020), quoting Zaleski v. Zaleski, 469 Mass. 230, 236 (2014).  Here, the judge carefully explained the basis for her orders.  As she found, the wife has no income and is currently unable to work because of her mental illness, whereas the husband has a stable job with significant income and \"will continue to accumulate income and assets as a result of that position.\"  The judge also considered that the husband \"has the ability to engage in a self-employment business that he grew in just two years into a stream of income to him of approximately one thousand dollars per week in gross income.\"[6]  This was not error, as the husband suggests.  Although the judge credited the husband's testimony that he is currently unable to work beyond his full-time position while also caring for the child, it was still within the judge's discretion to consider the husband's potential future income from his self-employment business in calculating the alimony award.  See Drapek v. Drapek, 399 Mass. 240, 246-247 (1987).</p>\n<p>      After considering all of these factors, as well as the wife's ongoing obligation to pay for the visitation supervisor, the judge concluded that the respective support orders \"achieve[d] the most equitable result for the parties and [the] child.\"  In contesting this conclusion, the husband points out that, per the judge's calculations, the husband's weekly expenses are $1,585 while his weekly income after the payment of alimony and receipt of child support will be $1,035, leaving him with a shortfall of $550.  But even assuming these calculations are correct,[7] the husband still has not shown that the amount he was ordered to pay to the wife was plainly wrong or excessive.  The judge recognized that \"the marital lifestyle cannot be maintained by the parties post-divorce\" and that \"[b]oth parties will experience a downturn in their respective lifestyles.\"[8]  Thus, because the parties' \"financial resources are inadequate to maintain the marital standard of living,\" the judge appropriately endeavored to \"reach a fair balance of sacrifice\" between the parties in light of their respective financial circumstances.  Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 296 (2009).  See Calvin C. v. Amelia A., 99 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 720 (2021).  The husband's generalized assertions that he will bear the greater sacrifice do not demonstrate an abuse of the judge's broad discretion.</p>\n<p>      3.  Division of marital assets.  The judge awarded the wife fifty-five percent of the marital assets, which totaled about $1.2 million, reasoning that a slightly unequal division was warranted because of the husband's far greater ability to acquire income and assets in the future.  The husband claims that this was error, based largely on evidence that he sought to introduce through a postjudgment motion under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (1) and 60 (b) (6).  The husband did not file an appeal from the judge's order denying his rule 60 (b) motion, however.  As a result, these arguments are not properly before us.  See Visnick v. Hawley, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (2007).</p>\n<p>      The husband also claims that the judge erred by not dividing the wife's jewelry, which the judge found was gifted to her by her family before and during the marriage.  A judge has broad discretion not to allocate gifted assets when determining how to divide a marital estate equitably.  See Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619, 626 (2000).  The husband makes no reasoned argument why the judge's decision not to allocate the wife's gifted jewelry was an abuse of discretion.  Likewise, the husband's remaining challenges to the property division are too undeveloped to rise to the level of adequate appellate argument.  See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (9), as appearing in 481 Mass. 1628 (2019).</p>\n<p>      Conclusion.  So much of the second amended judgment of divorce nisi as pertains to the duration of the husband's alimony obligation is vacated, and the matter is remanded for entry of a judgment reflecting that the husband's alimony obligation will terminate in accordance with G. L. c. 208, § 49.  In all other respects, the second amended judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<em><strong>footnotes<br>\n</strong></em>\n<p>          [1] The second amended judgment entered nunc pro tunc to July 11, 2023, the date of the original judgment.  We therefore deem the husband's notice of appeal dated July 28, 2023, to be timely and to reference the second amended judgment.</p>\n<p>          [2] The GAL's report states that the visits occurred in 2019.  This discrepancy is not material to our analysis.</p>\n<p>          [3] The husband was born in 1974, and the wife was born in 1983.</p>\n<p>          [4] In the context of marriages that ended after the act's effective date, we construe George's reference to \"moving party\" to mean the party who has the burden of requesting deviation (i.e., the recipient spouse), whether the request is made during the divorce proceeding or by filing a complaint for modification.</p>\n<p>          [5] Several of the husband's individual arguments are unsupported by adequate discussion, citation to authority, the record, or citation thereto, so we need not address them.  See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (9), as appearing in 481 Mass. 1628 (2019).  These include the husband's arguments that the judge erred under Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 490 Mass. 398 (2022), by including employer retirement contributions in his income, and that the judge failed to consider the increased cost to the husband if he needs to refinance his condominium.</p>\n<p>               [6] Specifically, the judge found that the husband earned $19,093 in 2020 and $47,225 in 2021 from his self-employment business.</p>\n<p>          [7] In determining the husband's net income, the judge took his gross annual income of $157,500 and subtracted his tax obligations, which the parties stipulated to be thirty-two percent for Federal taxes and 5.5 percent for Massachusetts taxes.  It appears, however, that the judge incorrectly applied what is the husband's marginal Federal tax rate of thirty-two percent to his entire income, arriving at an after-tax annual income of approximately $98,000.  If the thirty-two percent figure is treated as the husband's marginal tax rate, and not his effective tax rate, his after-tax income would be considerably higher than what the judge found.  In any event, for purposes of this appeal, we accept the judge's calculations as the wife does not challenge them and any error inured to the husband's benefit, giving us more reason not to disturb the amount of the alimony award.</p>\n<p>               [8] The judge found that the wife's weekly expenses are $1,200 while her weekly income after receipt of alimony and payment of child support will be only $794.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\t</div>\n\n</div>",

Anthony, J.</p>\n<p>      Maureen E. Booth (Melanie D. Foxx also present) for the husband.</p>\n<p>      Marcus L. Scott for the wife.</p>\n<p>      SHIN, J.  A judge of the Probate and Family Court issued a second amended judgment of divorce nisi in which she deviated from the presumptive durational limit on alimony set out in G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b), and ordered the former husband (husband) to pay alimony to the former wife (wife) potentially for the remainder of the wife's life.  The husband appeals, arguing that the evidence did not support the judge's decision to deviate.  He further challenges the amount of the alimony award (and, relatedly, the amount of child support that the judge ordered the wife to pay to the husband) and the division of the marital estate.[1]  With respect to the duration of the husband's alimony payments, we agree that the judge should not have deviated from the presumptive limit because the wife failed to meet her burden of showing that the asserted ground for deviation, her mental health condition and resulting inability to work, is reasonably likely to persist beyond the presumptive termination date.  We therefore vacate the portion of the second amended judgment relating to the duration of the alimony award, without prejudice to the wife's renewing her request for deviation through a future complaint for modification.  As we are unpersuaded by the husband's remaining arguments, we affirm the second amended judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p>      Background.  The parties were married in India on October 25, 2009.  Their first child was born in February 2014.  Their second child, who was delivered in September 2020, was stillborn.  Both parties are highly educated.  The husband obtained a Ph.D. in 2004 and has worked continuously at a university in Boston since that time.  The wife obtained a master's degree in urban health in 2018 and worked at times during the marriage as a dental assistant.</p>\n<p>      The husband filed a complaint for divorce on May 20, 2021, on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  Trial was held on January 10, 2023.  Only two witnesses testified:  the husband, and the special master appointed to sell the former marital home.  The judge admitted several exhibits in evidence, including a report of the guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed to evaluate the issues of custody and a parenting plan for the parties' child.  The judge also accepted a stipulation of uncontested facts submitted by the parties.</p>\n<p>      The evidence regarding the wife's mental health condition, which was a key factor in the judge's determination of the alimony award, consisted of the GAL's report and the parties' stipulation.  The GAL's report, which the judge credited in full, describes a mental health evaluation that the wife was required to undergo in 2018 in connection with a District Court criminal case.  The doctor who conducted the evaluation, Roger Gray, issued a report in November 2018, diagnosing the wife with delusional disorder, persecutory type.  Dr. Gray noted, however, that schizophrenia could not be ruled out and that \"[t]he future expressions of [the wife's] disorder will most likely clarify the diagnostic question.\"</p>\n<p>      Later in his report, the GAL states that the wife was diagnosed with schizophrenia while visiting India in 2019, but that the evaluator indicated that follow up was necessary, which was not done.  The GAL's report also discusses an evaluation of the wife conducted in 2021 by psychiatrist Timothy Scarella.  During that evaluation the wife acknowledged she was depressed, but denied experiencing paranoia or delusions and claimed that Dr. Gray misdiagnosed her in 2018.  Dr. Scarella reported a working diagnosis of \"[m]ajor [d]epressive disorder, single episode, severe, partial remission.\"  The GAL's report further notes that the wife's therapist reported in 2021 that the wife presented as \"relatively clinically stable,\" did not show any signs of schizophrenia, and was working to manage \"her depressive and anxiety symptoms.\"  Ultimately, the GAL concluded that the wife's \"diagnosis and treatment still need clarification,\" and he recommended the services of a mental health case manager to help the wife develop a treatment plan targeted at her needs.</p>\n<p>      The parties' stipulation of uncontested facts also references the court-ordered evaluation conducted by Dr. Gray.  The parties agreed that Dr. Gray diagnosed the wife with delusional disorder, persecutory type, but could not rule out schizophrenia.  In addition the stipulation states that the parties \"reported to the GAL that she was diagnosed with [s]chizophrenia in India, while on visits there in 2018[2] and took medicine for same, evidence of which was presented to the GAL by the [h]usband.\"  In light of these diagnoses, the parties agreed that the wife's \"mental health is impaired\" and that, \"as a result of the impairment,\" she \"is limited in her ability to work and care for the child.\"</p>\n<p>      Based on these two documents, the judge found that the wife suffers from \"significant mental health issues.\"  In support the judge cited Dr. Gray's diagnosis of delusional disorder, persecutory type, or possible schizophrenia; the parties' report to the GAL that the wife was diagnosed with schizophrenia in India; and their stipulation regarding the wife's mental health impairment and inability to work or care for the child.  The judge also mentioned the opinion of the GAL that the stillbirth of the parties' second child in September 2020 aggravated the wife's mental health issues.</p>\n<p>      These findings then formed the basis of the judge's decision to deviate from the presumptive durational limit on alimony.  The judge determined that the length of the parties' marriage, for purposes of calculating alimony, was 139 months (about eleven and one-half years) and that the presumptive durational limit for marriages of this length would be ninety-seven months (about eight years).  The judge concluded, however, that the interests of justice required deviation because the wife \"suffers from significant mental illness,\" which renders her \"currently unable to engage in employment.\"  While acknowledging that \"the marriage was relatively short in duration,\" the judge reasoned that deviation was still warranted because the wife \"is entirely dependent on [the] [h]usband for her support as a result of her significant mental health issues.\"  The judge accordingly ordered the husband to pay alimony to the wife until either party's death,[3] the wife's remarriage, or further order of the court, whichever is first to occur.</p>\n<p>      Discussion.  1.  Duration of alimony.  Under G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b) (3), \"[i]f the length of the marriage is [fifteen] years or less, but more than [ten] years, general term alimony shall continue for not longer than [seventy] per cent of the number of months of the marriage.\"  A judge may deviate from this durational limit, however, \"upon a written finding . . . that deviation . . . [is] required in the interests of justice.\"  G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).  The husband contends that the interests of justice did not require deviation in this case because, although the parties stipulated that the wife is limited in her ability to work because of her mental illness, the judge had no evidence before her that the wife's condition is permanent.  In these circumstances, the husband says, the judge was obligated to enforce the presumptive limit of ninety-seven months and should have put the burden on the wife to request additional alimony through a complaint for modification if her mental condition is likely to affect her ability to work beyond that time period.  According to the husband, by instead deviating from the presumptive limit in the initial alimony order, the judge improperly put the burden on the husband to seek to terminate his alimony obligation after ninety-seven months, in contravention of the guidelines provided in George v. George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#69\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">476 Mass. 65, 69-71</a></span> (2016).</p>\n<p>      To the extent the husband is arguing that a complaint for modification is the sole vehicle through which a party may request deviation, we do not read George to stand for that proposition.  In George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#69\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">476 Mass. at 69-71</a></span>, the court set out guidelines for how judges should apply the \"interests of justice\" standard of G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).  At the start of that discussion, the court quoted G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e), which states that \"[i]n setting an initial alimony order, or in modifying an existing order, the court may deviate from duration and amount limits for general term alimony . . . upon written findings that deviation is necessary\" (emphasis added).  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#69\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">George, supra at 69</a></span>, quoting G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e).  The court then went on to state that \"a judge should evaluate the circumstances of the parties in the here and now, that is, as they exist at the time the deviation is sought, rather than the situation as it existed at the time of divorce.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#70\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">George, supra at 70</a></span>.  Viewing this statement in context, we do not construe the last clause -- \"rather than the situation as it existed at the time of divorce\" -- to mean that a judge cannot consider a request for deviation at the time of divorce, as that would be irreconcilable with G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e).  Rather, we believe that the court was addressing the specific question of how a judge should evaluate a request for deviation when raised in a modification proceeding.  But when, as here, the request is made in a divorce proceeding, it is consistent with G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e), and procedurally proper, for a judge to consider whether to deviate in setting the initial alimony order.</p>\n<p>      That said, we agree with the husband that the judge's findings do not demonstrate that deviation was warranted.  For marriages such as this one that ended after the effective date of the Alimony Reform Act, St. 2011, c. 124 (act), the presumptive durational limits apply unless the recipient spouse \"prov[es] by a preponderance of the evidence that deviation beyond the presumptive termination date is 'required in the interests of justice.'\"  George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#70\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">476 Mass. at 70</a></span>, quoting G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).  Because a judge deciding a request for deviation must \"evaluate the circumstances of the parties in the here and now,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">George, supra,</a></span> it follows that, when the request is made in a divorce proceeding, as opposed to a modification proceeding, the recipient spouse has the burden of proving that the interests of justice require deviation at the time of the divorce.  This means in turn that the recipient spouse must prove that the grounds for deviation asserted at the time of the divorce are reasonably likely to be present beyond the presumptive termination date.</p>\n<p>      Here, the judge made no findings about the extent to which the wife's mental illness and resulting inability to work would continue beyond the presumptive termination date.  The act sets forth a nonexhaustive list of \"[g]rounds for deviation,\" including a recipient spouse's \"chronic illness\" or \"unusual health circumstances,\" \"inability to provide for [her] own support by reason of [her] deficiency of property, maintenance or employment opportunity,\" and \"any other factor that the court deems relevant and material.\"  G. L. c. 208, § 53 (e).  While the judge correctly cited these factors, and placed the burden of proof on the wife in accordance with George, in the end the judge found only that the wife proved she is \"currently\" unable to work; the judge did not find that the wife's mental health condition cannot be treated or that it will likely prevent her from working beyond the presumptive durational limit of ninety-seven months.  To the extent such findings are implicit in the judge's decision, they are clearly erroneous because there is no record evidence to support them.  As mentioned, the GAL's report, credited by the judge, states that the wife's \"diagnosis and treatment still need clarification.\"  The GAL further noted that the wife is currently being treated for depression as the primary issue, rather than the issues diagnosed in 2018.  And again, the judge found the wife to be highly educated and that she worked intermittently as a dental assistant during the marriage.</p>\n<p>      In light of the entire record, we agree with the husband that the evidence does not support a finding that the wife's current mental health issues and their effect on her employability would persist beyond ninety-seven months.  Absent such evidence the wife did not meet her burden of proving that the interests of justice require deviation from the presumptive durational limit in the \"here and now,\" that is, at the time of the divorce.  George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#70\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">476 Mass. at 70</a></span>.  The judge thus erred by deviating in the initial alimony order and, by doing so, improperly shifted the burden to the husband to file a complaint for modification to terminate his alimony obligation on the presumptive date.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#69\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">id. at 69</a></span> (\"for marriages that ended after [the act's effective] date, the recipient spouse will be the moving party[4]\").</p>\n<p>      We stress that nothing we have said precludes the wife from filing a complaint for modification to extend the husband's alimony obligation beyond the presumptive date.  If the wife brings such a case, she will have the burden at that time of proving that deviation is warranted.  See George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/#70\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">476 Mass. at 70</a></span>.  In determining whether the wife has met her burden, \"the judge may properly consider the impact the [wife's] disability continues to have on [her] in determining whether deviation beyond the act's durational limits is 'required in the interests of justice.'\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4101818\"><a href=\"/opinion/4324557/george-v-george/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: George v. George\">Id.,</a></span> quoting G. L. c. 208, § 49 (b).</p>\n<p>      2.  Amount of alimony and child support.  Under G. L. c. 208, § 53 (b), \"the amount of alimony should generally not exceed the recipient's need or [thirty] to [thirty-five] per cent of the difference between the parties' gross incomes established at the time of the order being issued.\"  After determining the husband's income to be $157,500 and the wife's income to be zero, the judge ordered the husband to pay the wife $984 per week in alimony, equivalent to 32.5 percent of the difference between their incomes.  Then, applying the child support guidelines, the judge ordered the wife to pay the husband $190 per week in child support, resulting in a net weekly obligation to the husband of $794.</p>\n<p>      The husband does not challenge the judge's calculations but raises various arguments why the judge erred by declining to either reduce the alimony award or offset it by deviating upward from the child support guidelines.  At bottom these arguments amount to a claim that the respective support orders result in the husband's bearing a disproportionate share of the financial burden from the divorce, given that he has full custody of the parties' child.[5]  We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p>      A judge has broad discretion in determining the amount of alimony, and we will not reverse an award on appeal unless it is \"plainly wrong\" or \"excessive.\"  D.B. v. J.B., <span class=\"citation no-link\">97 Mass. App. Ct. 170</span>, 177 (2020), quoting Zaleski v. Zaleski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2708853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2708853/zaleski-v-zaleski/#236\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Zaleski v. Zaleski\">469 Mass. 230, 236</a></span> (2014).  Here, the judge carefully explained the basis for her orders.  As she found, the wife has no income and is currently unable to work because of her mental illness, whereas the husband has a stable job with significant income and \"will continue to accumulate income and assets as a result of that position.\"  The judge also considered that the husband \"has the ability to engage in a self-employment business that he grew in just two years into a stream of income to him of approximately one thousand dollars per week in gross income.\"[6]  This was not error, as the husband suggests.  Although the judge credited the husband's testimony that he is currently unable to work beyond his full-time position while also caring for the child, it was still within the judge's discretion to consider the husband's potential future income from his self-employment business in calculating the alimony award.  See Drapek v. Drapek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108121\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108121/drapek-v-drapek/#246\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Drapek v. Drapek\">399 Mass. 240, 246-247</a></span> (1987).</p>\n<p>      After considering all of these factors, as well as the wife's ongoing obligation to pay for the visitation supervisor, the judge concluded that the respective support orders \"achieve[d] the most equitable result for the parties and [the] child.\"  In contesting this conclusion, the husband points out that, per the judge's calculations, the husband's weekly expenses are $1,585 while his weekly income after the payment of alimony and receipt of child support will be $1,035, leaving him with a shortfall of $550.  But even assuming these calculations are correct,[7] the husband still has not shown that the amount he was ordered to pay to the wife was plainly wrong or excessive.  The judge recognized that \"the marital lifestyle cannot be maintained by the parties post-divorce\" and that \"[b]oth parties will experience a downturn in their respective lifestyles.\"[8]  Thus, because the parties' \"financial resources are inadequate to maintain the marital standard of living,\" the judge appropriately endeavored to \"reach a fair balance of sacrifice\" between the parties in light of their respective financial circumstances.  Pierce v. Pierce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6454206\"><a href=\"/opinion/6580076/pierce-v-pierce/#296\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Pierce v. Pierce\">455 Mass. 286, 296</a></span> (2009).  See Calvin C. v. Amelia A., <span class=\"citation no-link\">99 Mass. App. Ct. 714</span>, 720 (2021).  The husband's generalized assertions that he will bear the greater sacrifice do not demonstrate an abuse of the judge's broad discretion.</p>\n<p>      3.  Division of marital assets.  The judge awarded the wife fifty-five percent of the marital assets, which totaled about $1.2 million, reasoning that a slightly unequal division was warranted because of the husband's far greater ability to acquire income and assets in the future.  The husband claims that this was error, based largely on evidence that he sought to introduce through a postjudgment motion under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b) (1) and 60 (b) (6).  The husband did not file an appeal from the judge's order denying his rule 60 (b) motion, however.  As a result, these arguments are not properly before us.  See Visnick v. Hawley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6463053\"><a href=\"/opinion/6588681/visnick-v-hawley/#902\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Visnick v. Hawley\">69 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902</a></span> (2007).</p>\n<p>      The husband also claims that the judge erred by not dividing the wife's jewelry, which the judge found was gifted to her by her family before and during the marriage.  A judge has broad discretion not to allocate gifted assets when determining how to divide a marital estate equitably.  See Williams v. Massa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6452019\"><a href=\"/opinion/6578096/williams-v-massa/#626\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Williams v. Massa\">431 Mass. 619, 626</a></span> (2000).  The husband makes no reasoned argument why the judge's decision not to allocate the wife's gifted jewelry was an abuse of discretion.  Likewise, the husband's remaining challenges to the property division are too undeveloped to rise to the level of adequate appellate argument.  See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (9), as appearing in <span class=\"citation no-link\">481 Mass. 1628</span> (2019).</p>\n<p>      Conclusion.  So much of the second amended judgment of divorce nisi as pertains to the duration of the husband's alimony obligation is vacated, and the matter is remanded for entry of a judgment reflecting that the husband's alimony obligation will terminate in accordance with G. L. c. 208, § 49.  In all other respects, the second amended judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<em><strong>footnotes<br>\n</strong></em>\n<p>          [1] The second amended judgment entered nunc pro tunc to July 11, 2023, the date of the original judgment.  We therefore deem the husband's notice of appeal dated July 28, 2023, to be timely and to reference the second amended judgment.</p>\n<p>          [2] The GAL's report states that the visits occurred in 2019.  This discrepancy is not material to our analysis.</p>\n<p>          [3] The husband was born in 1974, and the wife was born in 1983.</p>\n<p>          [4] In the context of marriages that ended after the act's effective date, we construe George's reference to \"moving party\" to mean the party who has the burden of requesting deviation (i.e., the recipient spouse), whether the request is made during the divorce proceeding or by filing a complaint for modification.</p>\n<p>          [5] Several of the husband's individual arguments are unsupported by adequate discussion, citation to authority, the record, or citation thereto, so we need not address them.  See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (9), as appearing in <span class=\"citation no-link\">481 Mass. 1628</span> (2019).  These include the husband's arguments that the judge erred under Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, <span class=\"citation no-link\">490 Mass. 398</span> (2022), by including employer retirement contributions in his income, and that the judge failed to consider the increased cost to the husband if he needs to refinance his condominium.</p>\n<p>               [6] Specifically, the judge found that the husband earned $19,093 in 2020 and $47,225 in 2021 from his self-employment business.</p>\n<p>          [7] In determining the husband's net income, the judge took his gross annual income of $157,500 and subtracted his tax obligations, which the parties stipulated to be thirty-two percent for Federal taxes and 5.5 percent for Massachusetts taxes.  It appears, however, that the judge incorrectly applied what is the husband's marginal Federal tax rate of thirty-two percent to his entire income, arriving at an after-tax annual income of approximately $98,000.  If the thirty-two percent figure is treated as the husband's marginal tax rate, and not his effective tax rate, his after-tax income would be considerably higher than what the judge found.  In any event, for purposes of this appeal, we accept the judge's calculations as the wife does not challenge them and any error inured to the husband's benefit, giving us more reason not to disturb the amount of the alimony award.</p>\n<p>               [8] The judge found that the wife's weekly expenses are $1,200 while her weekly income after receipt of alimony and payment of child support will be only $794.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\t</div>\n\n</div>",

Rosado, Esquire, Miami, Florida\nFOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Evelin Mac Clay Migueles,\nAssistant Chief Counsel\nBEFORE: Board Panel: MALPHRUS, Chief Appellate Immigration Judge; MULLANE\nand GOODWIN, Appellate Immigration Judges.\nMULLANE, Appellate Immigration Judge:\n\n\n   The respondent is a native and citizen of Haiti. The Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”) appeals from an Immigration Judge’s\nOctober 28, 2024, decision granting his application for deferral of removal\nunder the regulations implementing the Convention Against Torture\n(“CAT”). 2 The respondent has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The\nappeal will be sustained.\n\n   The respondent has been diagnosed with schizophrenia; schizoaffective\ndisorder, depressive type; and major depressive disorder with psychotic\nsymptoms. He also has been hospitalized while detained and described\nas “actively psychotic with suicide ideations with a plan.”         The\nImmigration Judge’s finding that the respondent lacked sufficient\nmental competency to represent himself in removal proceedings under\n1\n   Pursuant to Order No. 6319-2025, dated July 8, 2025, the Attorney General designated\nthe Board’s decision in Matter of S-S- (BIA Jun. 16, 2025), as precedent in all proceedings\ninvolving the same issue or issues. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g)(3) (2025). Editorial changes\nhave been made consistent with the designation of the case as a precedent.\n2\n   The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85 (entered into\nforce for United States Nov. 20, 1994). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c), 1208.17 (2025);\n8 C.F.R.§ 1208.18(a) (2020).\n                                           Page\n                                           136\n\fCite as 29 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 2025)                          Interim Decision #4109\n\n\n\n\nMatter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474 (BIA 2011), is not at issue on appeal.\nLikewise, the Immigration Judge’s implementation of safeguards, including\nappointment of counsel, is not at issue.\n\n    The parties dispute whether the Immigration Judge erred in concluding\nthat the respondent established that he more likely than not would be tortured\nupon removal to Haiti. To establish eligibility for CAT protection, the\nrespondent must show that he more likely than not will be tortured if removed\nto Haiti. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a); see also Reyes Sanchez\nv. U.S. Att’y Gen., 369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir. 2004). The respondent\nfears: (1) as a mentally ill criminal deportee, he will be indefinitely detained\nupon removal to Haiti in conditions constituting torture; and (2) he will be\ntortured for being mentally ill, whether detained or not, by Haitian\nauthorities, gangs, or members of the community, by or with the\nacquiescence of a public official.\n\n   Relying on the United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy,\nHuman Rights, and Labor, 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\nfor Haiti and the testimony of expert witness Michelle Karshan, the\nImmigration Judge found that the respondent more likely than not would be\ndetained upon removal to Haiti as a criminal deportee without family\navailable to secure his release. The Immigration Judge further found that the\nrespondent faced increased risk of subsequent arrest and detention as a\ncriminal deportee, even after his release into Haiti.\n\n    The Immigration Judge did not determine whether the respondent’s\ndetention would more likely than not continue long term. See Bonnet v.\nGarland, 20 F.4th 80, 85–86 (1st Cir. 2021) (affirming the agency’s\ndetermination that there was insufficient evidence that the respondent would\nbe held in prolonged detention upon removal to Haiti). Along these lines,\nMs. Karshan provided different scenarios of what could happen to the\nrespondent upon return to Haiti, which included him being quickly released\nand being released upon a family member’s payment of a bribe. Ms. Karshan\nalso could not estimate how many criminal deportees were incarcerated or\nkilled in 2022 or 2023. Anecdotal reports of some criminal deportees being\nindefinitely detained in torturous conditions are insufficient to establish that\nthe respondent is more likely than not to have that experience. See Matter of\nA-A-R-, 29 I&N Dec. 38, 41–42 (BIA 2025). It is thus unclear whether the\nrespondent will be subjected to the detention conditions that he claims will\nconstitute torture. See Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. 912, 917–18, 918 n.4\n(A.G. 2006) (emphasizing that the Immigration Judge must identify each step\nin the hypothetical chain of events that will lead to the alien’s torture and that\neach link must be more likely than not to occur).\n                                      page\n                                       137\n\fCite as 29 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 2025)                         Interim Decision #4109\n\n\n\n\n    Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the respondent is detained long\nterm upon removal, we conclude upon de novo review that the Immigration\nJudge erred in determining that the conditions of the respondent’s detention\nwould constitute torture. See Matter of R-A-F-, 27 I&N Dec. 778, 779\n(A.G. 2020); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2025). The respondent’s\nallegations about the conditions he would face in long-term detention are\nsimilar to the conditions that we considered in Matter of J-E-, 23 I&N\nDec. 291 (BIA 2002). In that case, the respondent presented articles\nconfirming the assessment of the United States Department of State that\nprison conditions in Haiti were inhumane. Matter of J-E-, 23 I&N Dec.\nat 293. We concluded that although Haitian authorities were intentionally\ndetaining criminal deportees in knowingly substandard detention facilities,\nthe respondent did not show that they were intentionally and deliberately\nmaintaining such conditions to inflict torture. Id. at 301. The record instead\ndemonstrated that Haitian prison conditions were “the result of budgetary\nand management problems as well as the country’s severe economic\ndifficulties.” Id. The record also showed that the Haitian government freely\npermitted human rights groups to enter detention settings. Id. We therefore\nconcluded that the respondent had not demonstrated that the inhumane prison\nconditions were “specifically intended to inflict severe pain or suffering,” as\nrequired to constitute torture under the regulations. Id. at 300–01.\n\n    In this case, the respondent presented similar evidence of dangerous and\nunsanitary detention conditions in Haiti. The Immigration Judge did not find\nthat public officials are “intentionally and deliberately creating and\nmaintaining [harsh detention] conditions” that the respondent could be\nexposed to for the specific purpose of inflicting pain or suffering. Matter of\nJ-R-G-P-, 27 I&N Dec. 482, 484 (BIA 2018) (emphasis omitted) (quoting\nMatter of J-E-, 23 I&N Dec. at 301). Rather, the Immigration Judge’s\nfinding, based on Ms. Karshan’s testimony, that “prison guards and police\nhave the same lack of understanding of mental illness that is widespread\namong Haitian society” shows a lack of specific intent to torture mentally-ill\ndetainees. The instant case is therefore indistinguishable from Matter of\nJ-E-. The respondent’s failure to show that Haitian officials are intentionally\nand deliberately creating and maintaining the harsh detention conditions that\nhe fears for the specific purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering warrants\nreversal of the grant of his application for CAT protection. See Matter of\nA-A-R-, 29 I&N Dec. at 43; cf. Jean-Pierre v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 500 F.3d 1315,\n1324–27 (11th Cir. 2007) (remanding for additional analysis of whether the\nrespondent would specifically and individually be singled out for torture).\n\n  In addition, the Immigration Judge did not evaluate an IOM U.N.\nMigration report stating that the organization provides counseling,\n                                      page\n                                      138\n\fCite as 29 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 2025)                           Interim Decision #4109\n\n\n\n\nmedication, and bus money to deportees upon arrival in Haiti. Ms. Karshan\nfurther admitted that deportees sometimes receive necessary medication. As\ndiscussed, the respondent also has not shown that Haitian authorities\nmaintain inhumane detention conditions with the specific intent of torturing\ndetainees. See Matter of J-E-, 23 I&N Dec. at 300–01. We therefore reverse,\nas clearly erroneous, the Immigration Judge’s findings that the respondent is\nmore likely than not to be: (1) unable to receive medical treatment;\n(2) detained as a result; and (3) tortured in detention because he exhibits\nmental health symptoms. See Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917-18, 918\nn.4; see also Matter of R-A-F-, 27 I&N Dec. at 779 (holding that while the\nBoard reviews Immigration Judge’s predictive findings about what is likely\nto happen for clear error, whether the predicted outcome satisfies the legal\ndefinition of torture is a legal determination). Anecdotal reports of some\ninstances of people having been tortured in detention in Haiti, although\ndeplorable, are insufficient to show that the respondent is more likely than\nnot to experience harm rising to that level. See Matter of A-A-R-, 29 I&N\nDec. at 41–42; Matter of J-E-, 23 I&N Dec. at 303–04.\n\n    Regarding the respondent’s fear of being tortured outside of a detention\nsetting in Haiti, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent is\nvulnerable to being tortured by members of the community because his\nmental health conditions make it likely that he will exhibit erratic and\nabnormal behavior. The Immigration Judge did not identify each step in a\nhypothetical chain of events that would lead to the respondent’s torture in the\ncommunity and did not find that each event is more likely than not to occur.\nSee Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917–18, 918 n.4. The Immigration\nJudge’s finding that the respondent would be “vulnerable” to torture is\ninsufficient, as the respondent bears the burden of showing that he more\nlikely than not will be tortured upon removal to Haiti. See Reyes Sanchez,\n369 F.3d at 1242; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a); see also Matter of\nN-N-B-, 29 I&N Dec. 79, 80 (BIA 2025) (concluding that in finding the\nrespondent “could be” subject to torture, the Immigration Judge applied the\nwrong legal standard). Further, generalized evidence that some gangs have\nties to politicians and police in Haiti is insufficient to establish that the police\ncannot or will not help the respondent in his individual case, as required for\nhim to prove acquiescence. See Matter of M-S-I-, 29 I&N Dec. 61, 64\n(BIA 2025).\n\n    Overall, we conclude that the Immigration Judge factually and legally\nerred in determining that the respondent established that he more likely\nthan not would be “tortured” by or with the acquiescence (including\nthe concept of willful blindness) of a public official of the Haitian\ngovernment upon removal.

To establish eligibility for CAT protection, the\nrespondent must show that he more likely than not will be tortured if removed\nto Haiti. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c)(2), 1208.18(a); see also Reyes Sanchez\nv.

U.S. Atty. Gen.\">369 F.3d 1239, 1242</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2004). The respondent\nfears: (1) as a mentally ill criminal deportee, he will be indefinitely detained\nupon removal to Haiti in conditions constituting torture; and (2) he will be\ntortured for being mentally ill, whether detained or not, by Haitian\nauthorities, gangs, or members of the community, by or with the\nacquiescence of a public official.\n\n   Relying on the United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy,\nHuman Rights, and Labor, 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\nfor Haiti and the testimony of expert witness Michelle Karshan, the\nImmigration Judge found that the respondent more likely than not would be\ndetained upon removal to Haiti as a criminal deportee without family\navailable to secure his release. The Immigration Judge further found that the\nrespondent faced increased risk of subsequent arrest and detention as a\ncriminal deportee, even after his release into Haiti.\n\n    The Immigration Judge did not determine whether the respondent’s\ndetention would more likely than not continue long term. See Bonnet v.\nGarland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">20 F.4th 80</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85–86 (1st Cir. 2021) (affirming the agency’s\ndetermination that there was insufficient evidence that the respondent would\nbe held in prolonged detention upon removal to Haiti). Along these lines,\nMs. Karshan provided different scenarios of what could happen to the\nrespondent upon return to Haiti, which included him being quickly released\nand being released upon a family member’s payment of a bribe. Ms. Karshan\nalso could not estimate how many criminal deportees were incarcerated or\nkilled in 2022 or 2023. Anecdotal reports of some criminal deportees being\nindefinitely detained in torturous conditions are insufficient to establish that\nthe respondent is more likely than not to have that experience.

See Matter of R-A-F-, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5663785\"><a href=\"/opinion/5808436/raf/#779\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: R‑A‑F‑\">27 I&amp;N Dec. 778, 779</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(A.G. 2020); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 C.F.R. § 1003.1</span><pre class=\"inline\">(d)(3)(ii) (2025).

In that case, the respondent presented articles\nconfirming the assessment of the United States Department of State that\nprison conditions in Haiti were inhumane. Matter of J-E-, 23 I&amp;N Dec.\nat 293. We concluded that although Haitian authorities were intentionally\ndetaining criminal deportees in knowingly substandard detention facilities,\nthe respondent did not show that they were intentionally and deliberately\nmaintaining such conditions to inflict torture. Id. at 301. The record instead\ndemonstrated that Haitian prison conditions were “the result of budgetary\nand management problems as well as the country’s severe economic\ndifficulties.” Id. The record also showed that the Haitian government freely\npermitted human rights groups to enter detention settings. Id. We therefore\nconcluded that the respondent had not demonstrated that the inhumane prison\nconditions were “specifically intended to inflict severe pain or suffering,” as\nrequired to constitute torture under the regulations. Id. at 300–01.\n\n    In this case, the respondent presented similar evidence of dangerous and\nunsanitary detention conditions in Haiti. The Immigration Judge did not find\nthat public officials are “intentionally and deliberately creating and\nmaintaining [harsh detention] conditions” that the respondent could be\nexposed to for the specific purpose of inflicting pain or suffering.

Rather, the Immigration Judge’s\nfinding, based on Ms. Karshan’s testimony, that “prison guards and police\nhave the same lack of understanding of mental illness that is widespread\namong Haitian society” shows a lack of specific intent to torture mentally-ill\ndetainees. The instant case is therefore indistinguishable from Matter of\nJ-E-. The respondent’s failure to show that Haitian officials are intentionally\nand deliberately creating and maintaining the harsh detention conditions that\nhe fears for the specific purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering warrants\nreversal of the grant of his application for CAT protection.

S., appeals from the\n       judgment of the trial court granting the motion filed by\n       the self-represented plaintiff, S. S., to extend a restraining\n       order issued against him pursuant to General Statutes\n       § 46b-15.1 On appeal, the defendant claims that the court\n       abused its discretion in extending the order because\n       there was insufficient evidence that, at the time the plain-\n       tiff sought the extension, the defendant posed a continu-\n       ous threat of present physical pain or physical injury\n       to her.2 We affirm the judgment of the court.\n         The following facts, as found by the trial court or\n       as otherwise undisputed in the record, and procedural\n       history are relevant to this appeal. On February 8, 2023,\n       the plaintiff filed an ex parte application in New Haven\n       Superior Court for relief from abuse against the defen-\n       dant pursuant to § 46b-15 (application). At the time of\n         1\n            General Statutes § 46b-15 provides in relevant part: ‘‘(a) Any family or\n       household member . . . who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined\n       in section 46b-1, by another family or household member may make an\n       application to the Superior Court for relief under this section.\n                                              ***\n          ‘‘(g) No order of the court shall exceed one year, except that an order\n       may be extended by the court upon motion of the applicant for such addi-\n       tional time as the court deems necessary. . . .’’\n          General Statutes § 46b-1 provides in relevant part: ‘‘(b) As used in this\n       title, ‘domestic violence’ means: (1) A continuous threat of present physical\n       pain or physical injury against a family or household member . . . (2) stalk-\n       ing . . . of such family or household member; (3) a pattern of threatening\n       . . . of such family or household member or a third party that intimidates\n       such family or household member; or (4) coercive control of such family\n       or household member, which is a pattern of behavior that in purpose or effect\n       unreasonably interferes with a person’s free will and personal liberty. . . .’’\n          2\n            The plaintiff did not file a brief with this court. We therefore consider\n       the appeal solely on the basis of the defendant’s brief, oral argument, and\n       the record. See, e.g., Kathrynne S. v. Swetz, 191 Conn. App. 850, 852 n.2,\n       216 A.3d 858 (2019).\n\fPage 2                   CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                        0, 0\n\n\n\n\n         4                   ,0                     0 Conn. App. 1\n                                  S. S. v. J. S.\n\n         the application, the parties, who had been married for\n         more than thirty years and who have three adult chil-\n         dren, were engaged in a contested dissolution action\n         in the Superior Court in Middletown. The parties pre-\n         viously had resided together in their marital home in\n         Guilford, but, following the events alleged in the appli-\n         cation, the defendant moved to Florida, where he has\n         resided during the pendency of this case.\n             In her affidavit accompanying the application, the\n         plaintiff averred the following under oath. The defen-\n         dant put a recording device in the plaintiff’s purse with-\n         out her knowledge, which he used to record her while\n         she was at work. On November 14, 2022, when the\n         plaintiff arrived home from work, the defendant, who\n         was drunk, confronted her with a recording he had\n         taken of her, which he falsely believed captured audio\n         of her having sex with a coworker in her cubicle. He\n         ordered the plaintiff to sit down and then ‘‘back handed\n         [the plaintiff] so hard that [she] flew off the chair [she]\n         was sitting in.’’ The plaintiff attempted to hide under a\n         desk, but the defendant continued to hit her. She then\n         went upstairs to use the bathroom, but the defendant\n         followed her, ‘‘back handed [her] repeatedly’’ while she\n         was sitting on the toilet, and then picked her up by\n         the neck and held her against the wall. The defendant\n         ‘‘ripped clumps of hair out of [the plaintiff’s] head’’ and\n         left bruises ‘‘all over [her] body.’’ The next day, the\n         plaintiff called out of work because she had been badly\n         beaten and had ‘‘lost [her] voice from screaming in fear\n         the day before.’’\n           The plaintiff further averred that, throughout their\n         marriage, the defendant had engaged in acts of domestic\n         violence, such as pushing her and pulling hair out of\n         her head. In the past, the plaintiff’s children had to ‘‘get\n         into the middle of the [defendant] and [the plaintiff] in\n         order to protect [her] from his violence.’’ Two weeks\n         before the November 14, 2022 incident, the defendant\n\f0, 0                        CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                   Page 3\n\n\n\n\n       0 Conn.

He was\n       charged in New Haven Superior Court with strangula-\n       tion in the second degree in violation of General Stat-\n       utes § 53a-64bb, assault in the third degree in violation\n       of General Statutes § 53a-61, threatening in the second\n       degree in violation of General Statutes § 53a-62, and\n       disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes\n       § 53a-182. A criminal protective order was issued against\n       him. The criminal case is still pending, and, at oral\n       argument before this court in November, 2024, counsel\n       for the defendant represented that the criminal protec-\n       tive order remains in effect.\n         On February 8, 2023, the same day the plaintiff filed\n       her application, the court, Gould, J., granted the appli-\n       cation and issued an ex parte restraining order against\n       the defendant for a period of one week. On February 15,\n       2023, the parties stipulated to the entry of a restraining\n       order against the defendant for one year, with the\n       exception that the order would not apply to any of the\n       parties’ pets. That same day, following a remote hearing3\n         3\n           Proceedings before the trial court were held remotely so that the defen-\n       dant could appear without having to travel to Connecticut from Florida.\n\fPage 4                         CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                      0, 0\n\n\n\n\n         6                          ,0                            0 Conn.

The defendant opposed\n         this motion. The court, Hon. James G. Kenefick, Jr.,\n         judge trial referee, held a remote hearing on the plain-\n         tiff’s motion on February 14, 2024, at which all parties\n         were present but only the plaintiff testified. In her testi-\n         mony, the plaintiff stated that, for her ‘‘peace of mind,’’\n         she wanted the restraining order to continue because\n         the parties’ dissolution litigation was ongoing and she\n         ‘‘still [was] not comfortable with just letting this go.’’\n         She added that ‘‘[i]t doesn’t matter [that the defendant]\n         lives in Florida right now; he could easily get on a plane\n         or in a car and come here.’’ She explained that the\n         parties continued to jointly own the marital home and\n         stated: ‘‘I’m not comfortable with [the restraining order]\n         ending. Absolutely not. . . . I mean, if they could\n         extend [the restraining order] longer than a year after\n         this, I would appreciate that.’’ She affirmed the truth\n         of the statements that she made in the affidavit accom-\n         panying her original application.\n            4\n              The criminal protective order is not part of the record. At the February\n         14, 2024 hearing, however—which we discuss subsequently in this opinion—\n         the court consulted the protection order registry, located the criminal protec-\n         tive order, and summarized its terms as ‘‘no assaulting, threatening, et cetera,\n         stay away from the home, no contact, he can return once to get his belong-\n         ings, stay 100 yards away . . . .’’\n\f0, 0                         CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                     Page 5\n\n\n\n\n       0 Conn.

S.\n\n          The court continued the matter to March 20, 2024—\n       leaving the restraining order in effect until that date—\n       in order to allow the defendant time to file a brief\n       addressing the court’s statutory authority to extend the\n       order. The defendant filed his brief on March 7, 2024.\n       On March 20, 2024, the court issued an order extending\n       the restraining order for an additional year. The court\n       found the plaintiff’s testimony at the February 14, 2024\n       hearing to have been credible. The court further found\n       that the allegations of abuse set forth in the affidavit\n       accompanying the application were ‘‘very significant\n       and serious’’; that the defendant was arrested in connec-\n       tion with this abuse and was currently subject to a\n       criminal protective order with no expiration date; that,\n       although the defendant resided in Florida, the parties\n       were engaged in contested dissolution litigation and\n       continued to jointly own the marital home where the\n       plaintiff resided; and that, notwithstanding the defen-\n       dant’s compliance with the restraining order and crimi-\n       nal protective order, the plaintiff ‘‘is still fearful of the\n       [defendant] because of the significant abuse she suf-\n       fered from him in the past.’’ This appeal followed.5\n          The defendant claims that the court abused its discre-\n       tion in granting the plaintiff’s motion for an extension\n       of the restraining order because the plaintiff failed to\n       present sufficient evidence that he posed a continuous\n       threat of present physical pain or injury to her.6 In\n          5\n            On March 27, 2024, one week after the restraining order was extended,\n       the defendant notified the court overseeing the parties’ dissolution action\n       that the parties had settled the dissolution, which had been scheduled for\n       trial starting on April 2, 2024. On April 2, 2024, two days before this appeal\n       was filed, the dissolution court, Sanchez-Figueroa, J., rendered a judgment\n       of uncontested dissolution. Three months later, on July 2, 2024, the plaintiff\n       filed a motion for contempt, which the dissolution court, Nugent, J., marked\n       off on October 2, 2024.

Ricky S., 124 Conn. App. 170, 3 A.3d\n         1061 (2010). In Joni S., this court applied the ‘‘continuous threat’’ standard\n         in an appeal from the trial court’s extension of a restraining order and\n         concluded that, because sufficient evidence established the existence of\n         such a threat, the trial court had not erred in granting the extension. Id.,\n         175. The court in Joni S. derived the ‘‘continuous threat’’ standard from the\n         language of § 46b-15 (a), which, at the time, provided in relevant part: ‘‘Any\n         family or household member . . . who has been subjected to a continuous\n         threat of present physical pain or physical injury by another family or\n         household member . . . may make an application to the Superior Court\n         for relief under this section.’’ General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) § 46b-15 (a);\n         see also Joni S. v. Ricky S., supra, 171 n.1, 173.\n            Since this court’s decision in Joni S., § 46b-15 has been amended several\n         times. See, e.g., Public Acts 2021, No. 21-78, § 2. The revision of the statute\n         that has been in effect throughout the present case provides in relevant\n         part: ‘‘(a) Any family or household member . . . who is the victim of domes-\n         tic violence, as defined in section 46b-1, by another family or household\n         member may make an application to the Superior Court for relief under\n         this section.’’ (Emphasis added.) General Statutes § 46b-15 (a).\n            General Statutes § 46b-1 (b) defines ‘‘ ‘domestic violence’ ’’ to include ‘‘[a]\n         continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury,’’ but also to\n         encompass other behaviors, such as ‘‘stalking,’’ ‘‘a pattern of threatening,’’\n         and ‘‘coercive control . . . .’’ See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n            Because we conclude that the plaintiff in the present case presented\n         sufficient evidence of a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical\n         injury, we need not and do not consider whether sufficient evidence of any\n         of the other behaviors enumerated in § 46b-1 (b), in the absence of sufficient\n         evidence of a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury,\n\f0, 0                        CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                   Page 7\n\n\n\n\n       0 Conn.

The\n       court reasonably could have concluded from these facts\n       that the defendant’s attitude toward the plaintiff\n       remained volatile and vulnerable to the emotional strain\n       that matrimonial litigation can engender and that the\n       defendant, had he decided to travel to Connecticut,\n       would justify the court, in its discretion, in extending a restraining order\n       issued pursuant to § 46b-15.\n\fPage 8                         CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                     0, 0\n\n\n\n\n         10                          ,0                           0 Conn.

See Rosemarie B.-F. v. Curtis\n         P., 133 Conn.

Lastly, the court\n         reasonably could have considered these facts and con-\n         clusions to be particularly salient to its risk assessment\n         in light of the defendant’s history of abuse toward the\n         plaintiff. The allegations in the plaintiff’s affidavit\n         accompanying her original application—the truth of\n         which the plaintiff affirmed in testimony that the court\n         found credible—were extremely serious. They described\n         a history of assaultive and controlling behavior by the\n         defendant that spanned more than three decades of\n         marriage, culminating in a brutal act of physical vio-\n         lence that led to felony charges being brought against\n         the defendant.\n            The defendant points to his compliance with the\n         restraining order and his current residence in Florida\n         as evidence that he no longer poses a threat of physical\n         injury to the plaintiff.8 These were certainly appropriate\n         factors for the court to consider in rendering its deci-\n         sion, but they did not compel the court to allow the\n         restraining order to expire. Nothing in the language of\n           7\n              We note that, in her affidavit, the plaintiff alleged that nine days after\n         the defendant moved to Florida, he returned to the marital home and\n         ‘‘scream[ed] that he wanted [the plaintiff] and [her] son out of the house.’’\n            8\n              At oral argument before this court, the defendant narrowed his position,\n         arguing that his compliance with the restraining order, standing alone,\n         should have barred the court from extending the order as a matter of law.\n         We reject that argument for the reasons we set forth in this opinion.\n\f0, 0                    CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                     Page 9\n\n\n\n\n       0 Conn.

S. v. D. M., 228 Conn. App. 559, 324 A.3d 233 (2024),\n          to illustrate ‘‘how the court heavily weighs specific behaviors when making\n          the necessary factual findings to determine whether grounds exist for contin-\n          uing a civil protective order’’ and for the proposition that ‘‘specificity and\n          seriousness in pleading’’ are required in order to secure an extension of\n          a restraining order. We are not persuaded that S. S. is apposite to the\n          present case.\n            In S. S., this court reversed the judgment of the trial court granting the\n          plaintiff’s application for an order of civil protection pursuant to General\n          Statutes § 46b-16a on the basis of stalking. S. S. v. D. M., supra, 228 Conn. App.\n          567–68. This court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion\n          by failing to make factual findings that there were reasonable grounds to\n          believe that the defendant had stalked and would continue to stalk the\n          plaintiff. Id., 567. The defendant in the present case, however, does not\n          claim that the court failed to make the necessary factual findings to support\n          the extension of the restraining order; instead, he argues that the evidence\n          before the court was insufficient to justify the extension. These claims are\n          distinct. Indeed, in S. S., the defendant had made a separate claim that the\n          evidence was insufficient to establish reasonable grounds to believe that\n          he had stalked the plaintiff, and this court expressly declined to reach that\n          claim. Id., 565 n.5. S. S. thus sheds little, if any, light on the appropriate\n          resolution of this appeal.\n\f",

S., to extend a restraining\n       order issued against him pursuant to General Statutes\n       § 46b-15.1 On appeal, the defendant claims that the court\n       abused its discretion in extending the order because\n       there was insufficient evidence that, at the time the plain-\n       tiff sought the extension, the defendant posed a continu-\n       ous threat of present physical pain or physical injury\n       to her.2 We affirm the judgment of the court.\n         The following facts, as found by the trial court or\n       as otherwise undisputed in the record, and procedural\n       history are relevant to this appeal. On February 8, 2023,\n       the plaintiff filed an ex parte application in New Haven\n       Superior Court for relief from abuse against the defen-\n       dant pursuant to § 46b-15 (application). At the time of\n         1\n            General Statutes § 46b-15 provides in relevant part: ‘‘(a) Any family or\n       household member . . . who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined\n       in section 46b-1, by another family or household member may make an\n       application to the Superior Court for relief under this section.\n                                              ***\n          ‘‘(g) No order of the court shall exceed one year, except that an order\n       may be extended by the court upon motion of the applicant for such addi-\n       tional time as the court deems necessary. . . .’’\n          General Statutes § 46b-1 provides in relevant part: ‘‘(b) As used in this\n       title, ‘domestic violence’ means: (1) A continuous threat of present physical\n       pain or physical injury against a family or household member . . . (2) stalk-\n       ing . . . of such family or household member; (3) a pattern of threatening\n       . . . of such family or household member or a third party that intimidates\n       such family or household member; or (4) coercive control of such family\n       or household member, which is a pattern of behavior that in purpose or effect\n       unreasonably interferes with a person’s free will and personal liberty. . . .’’\n          2\n            The plaintiff did not file a brief with this court.

The parties pre-\n         viously had resided together in their marital home in\n         Guilford, but, following the events alleged in the appli-\n         cation, the defendant moved to Florida, where he has\n         resided during the pendency of this case.\n             In her affidavit accompanying the application, the\n         plaintiff averred the following under oath. The defen-\n         dant put a recording device in the plaintiff’s purse with-\n         out her knowledge, which he used to record her while\n         she was at work. On November 14, 2022, when the\n         plaintiff arrived home from work, the defendant, who\n         was drunk, confronted her with a recording he had\n         taken of her, which he falsely believed captured audio\n         of her having sex with a coworker in her cubicle. He\n         ordered the plaintiff to sit down and then ‘‘back handed\n         [the plaintiff] so hard that [she] flew off the chair [she]\n         was sitting in.’’ The plaintiff attempted to hide under a\n         desk, but the defendant continued to hit her. She then\n         went upstairs to use the bathroom, but the defendant\n         followed her, ‘‘back handed [her] repeatedly’’ while she\n         was sitting on the toilet, and then picked her up by\n         the neck and held her against the wall. The defendant\n         ‘‘ripped clumps of hair out of [the plaintiff’s] head’’ and\n         left bruises ‘‘all over [her] body.’’ The next day, the\n         plaintiff called out of work because she had been badly\n         beaten and had ‘‘lost [her] voice from screaming in fear\n         the day before.’’\n           The plaintiff further averred that, throughout their\n         marriage, the defendant had engaged in acts of domestic\n         violence, such as pushing her and pulling hair out of\n         her head. In the past, the plaintiff’s children had to ‘‘get\n         into the middle of the [defendant] and [the plaintiff] in\n         order to protect [her] from his violence.’’ Two weeks\n         before the November 14, 2022 incident, the defendant\n\f0, 0                        CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                   Page 3\n\n\n\n\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">0 Conn.

He was\n       charged in New Haven Superior Court with strangula-\n       tion in the second degree in violation of General Stat-\n       utes § 53a-64bb, assault in the third degree in violation\n       of General Statutes § 53a-61, threatening in the second\n       degree in violation of General Statutes § 53a-62, and\n       disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes\n       § 53a-182. A criminal protective order was issued against\n       him. The criminal case is still pending, and, at oral\n       argument before this court in November, 2024, counsel\n       for the defendant represented that the criminal protec-\n       tive order remains in effect.\n         On February 8, 2023, the same day the plaintiff filed\n       her application, the court, Gould, J., granted the appli-\n       cation and issued an ex parte restraining order against\n       the defendant for a period of one week. On February 15,\n       2023, the parties stipulated to the entry of a restraining\n       order against the defendant for one year, with the\n       exception that the order would not apply to any of the\n       parties’ pets.

The defendant opposed\n         this motion. The court, Hon. James G.

In her testi-\n         mony, the plaintiff stated that, for her ‘‘peace of mind,’’\n         she wanted the restraining order to continue because\n         the parties’ dissolution litigation was ongoing and she\n         ‘‘still [was] not comfortable with just letting this go.’’\n         She added that ‘‘[i]t doesn’t matter [that the defendant]\n         lives in Florida right now; he could easily get on a plane\n         or in a car and come here.’’ She explained that the\n         parties continued to jointly own the marital home and\n         stated: ‘‘I’m not comfortable with [the restraining order]\n         ending. Absolutely not. . . . I mean, if they could\n         extend [the restraining order] longer than a year after\n         this, I would appreciate that.’’ She affirmed the truth\n         of the statements that she made in the affidavit accom-\n         panying her original application.\n            4\n              The criminal protective order is not part of the record. At the February\n         14, 2024 hearing, however—which we discuss subsequently in this opinion—\n         the court consulted the protection order registry, located the criminal protec-\n         tive order, and summarized its terms as ‘‘no assaulting, threatening, et cetera,\n         stay away from the home, no contact, he can return once to get his belong-\n         ings, stay 100 yards away . . . .’’\n\f0, 0                         CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                     Page 5\n\n\n\n\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">0 Conn.

The court further found\n       that the allegations of abuse set forth in the affidavit\n       accompanying the application were ‘‘very significant\n       and serious’’; that the defendant was arrested in connec-\n       tion with this abuse and was currently subject to a\n       criminal protective order with no expiration date; that,\n       although the defendant resided in Florida, the parties\n       were engaged in contested dissolution litigation and\n       continued to jointly own the marital home where the\n       plaintiff resided; and that, notwithstanding the defen-\n       dant’s compliance with the restraining order and crimi-\n       nal protective order, the plaintiff ‘‘is still fearful of the\n       [defendant] because of the significant abuse she suf-\n       fered from him in the past.’’ This appeal followed.5\n          The defendant claims that the court abused its discre-\n       tion in granting the plaintiff’s motion for an extension\n       of the restraining order because the plaintiff failed to\n       present sufficient evidence that he posed a continuous\n       threat of present physical pain or injury to her.6 In\n          5\n            On March 27, 2024, one week after the restraining order was extended,\n       the defendant notified the court overseeing the parties’ dissolution action\n       that the parties had settled the dissolution, which had been scheduled for\n       trial starting on April 2, 2024. On April 2, 2024, two days before this appeal\n       was filed, the dissolution court, Sanchez-Figueroa, J., rendered a judgment\n       of uncontested dissolution. Three months later, on July 2, 2024, the plaintiff\n       filed a motion for contempt, which the dissolution court, Nugent, J., marked\n       off on October 2, 2024.

The allegations in the plaintiff’s affidavit\n         accompanying her original application—the truth of\n         which the plaintiff affirmed in testimony that the court\n         found credible—were extremely serious. They described\n         a history of assaultive and controlling behavior by the\n         defendant that spanned more than three decades of\n         marriage, culminating in a brutal act of physical vio-\n         lence that led to felony charges being brought against\n         the defendant.\n            The defendant points to his compliance with the\n         restraining order and his current residence in Florida\n         as evidence that he no longer poses a threat of physical\n         injury to the plaintiff.8 These were certainly appropriate\n         factors for the court to consider in rendering its deci-\n         sion, but they did not compel the court to allow the\n         restraining order to expire.

Reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n                  Before Stark, P.J., Hruz, and Gill, JJ.\n\f                                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n        ¶1      STARK, P.J.1 Amanda appeals orders terminating her parental\nrights to her daughter, Lauren, and denying her postdisposition motion.2 Lauren’s\nguardians filed a petition for termination of Amanda’s parental rights (TPR),\nalleging, as relevant to this appeal, that Amanda abandoned Lauren during two\nspecific six-month periods. The matter was tried to a twelve-person jury, which\nwas instructed that there were two abandonment periods at issue, but it was not\ninstructed that it should separately consider each period of abandonment when\nanswering the verdict questions. The jury found that Amanda had abandoned\nLauren, but the verdict form did not permit the jurors to specify the period or\nperiods of abandonment on which they agreed. Amanda therefore argues that she\nwas deprived of her statutory and constitutional rights to a verdict by five-sixths of\n\n\n        1\n         Pursuant to WIS. STAT. § 752.31 (2023-24), cases under WIS. STAT. ch. 48 (2023-24)\nare decided by one judge. However, upon reviewing the briefs in this matter, this court\ndetermined that an issue raised by the appellant warranted consideration by three judges and\nsubsequently sua sponte ordered that this case be decided by three judges. See WIS. STAT.\nRULE 809.41(3) (2023-24).\n\n        All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2023-24 version.\n\n        Cases appealed under WIS. STAT. RULE 809.107 are “given preference and shall be taken\nin an order that ensures that a decision is issued within 30 days after the filing of the appellant’s\nreply.” RULE 809.107(6)(e). Conversion to a three-judge panel, in conjunction with conflicts in\nthis court’s calendar, has resulted in a delay. It is therefore necessary for this court to sua sponte\nextend the deadline for a decision in this case. See WIS. STAT. RULE 809.82(2)(a); Rhonda R.D.\nv. Franklin R.D., 191 Wis. 2d 680, 694, 530 N.W.2d 34 (Ct. App. 1995). Accordingly, we\nextend our deadline to the date this decision is issued.\n        2\n          For ease of reading, we refer to the appellant in this confidential matter using a\npseudonym, rather than her initials. We do the same for the child, the child’s biological father,\nand the child’s guardians.\n\n        We note that Amanda’s notice of appeal was taken from the order terminating her\nparental rights. During the pendency of her appeal, Amanda filed a postdisposition motion. We\ngranted a stay for the circuit court to decide the postdisposition motion, then granted Amanda’s\nmotion to extend the time for filing the statement on the transcript. As a result, we consider both\nthe order terminating Amanda’s parental rights and the order denying her postdisposition motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                                                                                   No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nthe jury on each of the alleged TPR elements during the grounds phase of the TPR\nprocess.3\n\n        ¶2      Amanda failed to raise this issue in the circuit court, and she\ntherefore claims that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to\nobject to the jury instruction and verdict form. Because this issue is one of first\nimpression in Wisconsin, we affirm the circuit court’s conclusion that trial counsel\ndid not perform deficiently by failing to object to the jury instruction and verdict\nform, as the law on this issue is unsettled.\n\n        ¶3      We further affirm the circuit court’s denial of Amanda’s motion for\na directed verdict after the close of the evidence, as viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the guardians, there was sufficient evidence of Amanda’s\nabandonment to permit the jury to decide the issue.\n\n        ¶4      We conclude, however, that both the circuit court’s failure to instruct\nthe jury that it must consider each period of abandonment separately when\nanswering the verdict and the court’s use of a special verdict form that failed to\nspecify during which period or periods Amanda was alleged to have abandoned\nLauren constituted plain error. This is because these errors deprived Amanda of\nher obvious and substantial right to a verdict by five-sixths of the jury on each of\nthe elements of abandonment. Whenever multiple periods of abandonment are\nalleged at trial, the jury instructions and verdict forms must require the jury to\n\n        3\n           A contested TPR proceeding involves a two-step procedure. Sheboygan Cnty. DHHS\nv. Julie A.B., 2002 WI 95, ¶24, 255 Wis. 2d 170, 648 N.W.2d 402. The first step is a factfinding\nhearing, in which a jury or circuit court determines “whether any grounds for the termination of\nparental rights have been” proved. Id., ¶26 (quoting WIS. STAT. § 48.424(3)). The termination\nproceedings then move to the second step, a dispositional hearing, at which the circuit court must\nconsider the best interests of the child. WIS. STAT. § 48.426(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f                                                                                   No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nmake a separate determination as to each alleged abandonment period. Further,\nwe determine that these errors were not harmless under the facts of this case.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order terminating Amanda’s parental rights to Lauren\nand the order denying Amanda’s postdisposition motion and remand to the circuit\ncourt for a new factfinding hearing.\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n       ¶5        Lauren was born to Amanda and Matthew in February 2010. In\nSeptember 2014, when Lauren was approximately four and one-half years old, she\nwas found to be a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS), and was\nremoved from Amanda’s care due to Amanda’s struggles with alcoholism. Lauren\nwas placed with Lisa and Shawn Smith, Lauren’s maternal aunt and her husband.\nAmanda was unsuccessful in completing the conditions for Lauren’s return home,\nand in 2017, the Smiths were granted guardianship of Lauren over Amanda’s\nobjection.\n\n       ¶6        In July 2019, the Smiths filed a petition for the termination of\nAmanda’s and Matthew’s parental rights, alleging grounds of abandonment and\nfailure to assume parental responsibility under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1) and (6),\nrespectively. Amanda and Matthew4 exercised their right to a jury trial during the\ngrounds phase of the TPR process. See WIS. STAT. § 48.422(4).\n\n       ¶7        As relevant to this appeal, the Smiths argued at trial that Amanda\nabandoned        Lauren      during      two     separate      six-month      periods:     from\n\n\n\n       4\n           Matthew is not participating in this appeal. We do not mention him further.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nNovember 1, 2017, to May 1, 2018; and from January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2019.\nWe briefly summarize the trial testimony pertinent to these allegations.\n\n         ¶8        Regarding the first alleged period of abandonment, Amanda testified\nthat from November 2017 to May 2018, she was living in Green Bay and Lauren\nwas residing with the Smiths.5 Amanda stated that while she did not have any\ncontact with Lauren during this time period, she did communicate with Lisa via\nemail, and she asserted that her lack of direct contact with Lauren was not her\nfault.\n\n         ¶9        Amanda testified that prior to the guardianship, i.e., from\nSeptember 2014 to April 2017, she was very involved in Lauren’s life. Amanda\nexplained that she had frequent visits with Lauren, both supervised and\nunsupervised. Many of Amanda’s supervised visits with Lauren took place at the\nBeacon Center, a supervised visitation center that was offered as a service to\nAmanda by the Brown County Department of Health and Human Services\n(DHHS). When the guardianship was granted, DHHS stopped providing services\nto Amanda, including use of the Beacon Center for visits with Lauren.\n\n         ¶10       Amanda testified that thereafter, Lisa began to exclude her from\ncontact with Lauren and from participating in Lauren’s activities. For example,\nAmanda was told she was no longer welcome to attend Lauren’s gymnastic\nclasses, and Lisa prohibited her from having lunch with Lauren at her school.\nAmanda stated that after the guardianship was granted, she attempted to establish\na visitation schedule through Lisa, but Lisa denied visitation on all the days that\n\n\n         5\n             Lisa testified that she and Shawn were residing in Green Bay at this time.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nAmanda requested, and the Smiths did not allow her any visits with Lauren.\nFurther, Lisa did not update Amanda on Lauren’s activities during the\nguardianship, which Lisa had agreed to do.\n\n       ¶11    Amanda testified that she emailed Lisa on April 22, 2018, asking to\nsee Lauren, noting that Lisa had not been returning her calls or texts and that she\nwas not being allowed to see Lauren at school. Amanda included her then-current\nphone number in the email, and the email was received into evidence. Amanda\ndid not recall Lisa responding to that email.\n\n       ¶12    Lisa testified that, after the guardianship was ordered, it was\nAmanda’s responsibility to contact her and schedule visits with Lauren. Lisa\nacknowledged that under the guardianship order, she was required to keep\nAmanda updated on Lauren’s extracurricular activities and she admitted she did\nnot always do so. Lisa stated that her relationship with Amanda became “a little\ndifficult” after the guardianship was ordered and that they then began to\ncommunicate with each other exclusively by email. Lisa testified that Amanda’s\nApril 22, 2018 email was the first time she heard from Amanda after the\nguardianship was ordered in April 2017, and she stated there was no contact\nbetween Amanda and Lauren in 2018 or 2019.\n\n       ¶13    Lisa denied interfering with Lauren and Amanda’s relationship. She\ntestified that she believed she responded to every email she received from\nAmanda. She acknowledged that she did take a lot of weekend trips but stated she\ndid not do so to keep Lauren from Amanda. She also denied sending a letter to\nLauren’s school saying that Amanda could not visit Lauren there.\n\n       ¶14    In May 2018, Amanda filed a petition to terminate the guardianship,\narguing that good cause existed to remove the Smiths as guardians and that there\n\n                                          6\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nhad been a substantial change in her circumstances. In August 2018, Amanda also\nfiled a petition to revise the guardianship order. These petitions were resolved\nthrough mediation with Amanda, the Smiths, and a guardian ad litem (GAL). The\nparties agreed that Amanda and Lauren would both see counselors and that the\nGAL would check on their progress to see if they could participate in therapy\ntogether.    Lauren’s therapist would decide when Lauren was ready to be\nreintroduced to Amanda.\n\n       ¶15    Regarding the second alleged period of abandonment, Amanda\ntestified that from January 2019 to July 2019, she continued to live in Green Bay,\nwhere Lauren continued residing with the Smiths. Amanda acknowledged that she\ndid not have any contact with Lauren during this period. However, Amanda\ntestified that she sent several emails to Lisa during this period asking for updates\non Lauren, asking whether she could purchase things for Lauren, and sending\nLauren birthday wishes.     Amanda also discussed, and entered into evidence,\nemails that she sent on January 29, 2019, and March 13, 2019, to her prior counsel\nand Lauren’s GAL asking for information on the status of Lauren’s counseling and\nattempting to schedule an appointment with Lauren’s therapist. Amanda stated\nthat she never received a response from the GAL or her counsel regarding her\nrequests to establish counseling with Lauren.\n\n       ¶16    Lisa acknowledged that she received emails from Amanda in\nJanuary and February 2019, and she stated that she responded to some of those\nemails. Aside from the emails, Lisa testified that she did not have any contact\nwith Amanda from January 1, 2019, through July 1, 2019. Lisa reiterated that it\nwas her understanding that Amanda remained responsible for scheduling visits\nwith Lauren both before and after the guardianship was ordered.\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶17    After the Smiths rested their case, Amanda moved for a directed\nverdict as to both of the alleged periods of abandonment as grounds for the TPR.\nAmanda contended that there was not any “legally sufficient evidentiary basis for\na reasonable jury to reach a different conclusion other than she has not abandoned\nher child” during either timeframe because the emails presented at trial showed\nthat she communicated with Lisa during the alleged periods of abandonment. The\ncircuit court found there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Amanda\nabandoned Lauren, and it denied Amanda’s motion as to both of the abandonment\nperiods.\n\n       ¶18    Relevant to the ground of abandonment, the circuit court instructed\nthe jury that the special verdict would be comprised of seven questions. For the\nfirst three questions, the burden was on the Smiths to prove those elements “by\nevidence that is clear, satisfactory and convincing to a reasonable certainty,” and\nfor the remaining four questions, the burden was on Amanda to prove those\nelements “by the greater weight of the credible evidence to a reasonable\ncertainty.”\n\n       ¶19    The circuit court then advised the jury that the TPR petition alleged\nthat Amanda abandoned Lauren “for the time period of November 1, 2017, to\nMay 1, 2018,” and that the petition also alleged “that [Lauren] has been\nabandoned from the time period of January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2019.” Regarding\nAmanda’s defense to abandonment, the court instructed the jury that it had to\ndetermine whether Amanda “had a reasonable opportunity to visit or communicate\nwith [Lauren] or communicate with the persons who had physical custody of\n[Lauren] during that period.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f                                                                               No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶20      The jury answered “Yes” to questions one, two and, three on the\nspecial verdict form, which asked, respectively, “Was [Lauren] left by [Amanda]\nwith a relative or other person?,” “Did [Amanda] know, or could she have\ndiscovered, [Lauren’s] whereabouts?,” and “Did [Amanda] fail to visit or\ncommunicate with [Lauren] for a period of 6 months or longer?” Question four\nasked, “Did [Amanda] have good cause for having failed to visit with [Lauren]\nduring that period?,” which the jury answered, “No.” Because the jury answered\n“No” to question four, the remaining questions were intentionally left blank. 6 See\nWIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018). Two jurors dissented from the abandonment\nverdict. The jury also returned a verdict finding that Amanda did not fail to\nassume parental responsibility for Lauren.\n\n       ¶21      During the dispositional phase of the TPR process, the circuit court\nentered an order terminating Amanda’s parental rights to Lauren after determining\nthat it would be in Lauren’s best interests to do so.               Amanda then filed a\npostdisposition motion to vacate the TPR order, arguing that she was denied\nconstitutionally effective assistance of counsel based on her counsel’s failure to\nobject to the jury instructions and verdict form because they failed to require the\njury to separately consider whether she abandoned Lauren during each specific\ntime period alleged. After a Machner7 hearing, the circuit court denied Amanda’s\nmotion, stating that the issue Amanda argued “is still unsettled law” and that\n\n\n       6\n          Question five asked, “Did [Amanda] have good cause for having failed to communicate\nwith [Lauren] during that period?” Question six asked, “Did [Amanda] communicate about\n[Lauren] with the persons who had physical custody of the child during that period?” Question\nseven asked, “Did [Amanda] have good cause for having failed to communicate about [Lauren]\nwith the persons who had physical custody of the child?”\n       7\n           See State v. Machner, 92 Wis. 2d 797, 285 N.W.2d 905 (Ct. App. 1979).\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f                                                                     No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n“[t]rial counsel cannot be found ineffective if the law is unclear.” Amanda now\nappeals.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\nI. Directed Verdict.\n\n         ¶22   We first address Amanda’s claim that the circuit court erred by\ndenying her motion for a directed verdict as to the second alleged period of\nabandonment.      Amanda contends that she had good cause for failing to\ncommunicate or visit with Lauren during the second abandonment period because\nthe GAL and Lisa prevented her from doing so and that “there is no credible\nevidence that could support the jury rejecting [her] good cause defense” for that\nalleged period of abandonment.\n\n         ¶23   A motion for a directed verdict is authorized under WIS. STAT.\n§ 805.14(4), which provides that after “the close of all evidence” during a jury\ntrial, “any party may challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of law\nby moving for directed verdict or dismissal or by moving the court to find as a\nmatter of law upon any claim or defense or upon any element or ground thereof.”\nDirected verdicts are permitted in civil proceedings, including TPR proceedings.\nDoor Cnty. DHFS v. Scott S., 230 Wis. 2d 460, 465, 602 N.W.2d 167 (Ct. App.\n1999).\n\n         ¶24   In reviewing a denied motion for directed verdict, we consider\nwhether, taking into account “all credible evidence and reasonable inferences\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion was\nmade, there is any credible evidence to sustain a finding in favor of that party.”\nWarren v. American Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., 122 Wis. 2d 381, 384, 361 N.W.2d 724\n\n\n                                       10\n\f                                                                                 No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n(Ct. App. 1984); WIS. STAT. § 805.14(1). “If there is any credible evidence to\nsustain a cause of action, the case must be submitted to the jury. Except in the\nclearest of cases, a trial judge should withhold ruling on a directed verdict and\npermit the question to go to the jury.” Warren, 122 Wis. 2d at 384.8 Further,\n\n               [t]he jury is to be the trier of the facts and, in any\n               circumstances where the facts are disputed or where\n               different inferences may be drawn from the facts, the jury\n               is to be the factfinder. Accordingly, a [circuit] court may\n               take a matter from the jury in only very limited\n               circumstances.\n\nMillonig v. Bakken, 112 Wis. 2d 445, 449, 334 N.W.2d 80 (1983).\n\n       ¶25     The Smiths argued that Amanda abandoned Lauren as provided in\nWIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3., which requires proof, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that “[t]he child has been left by the parent with any person, the parent\nknows or could discover the whereabouts of the child and the parent has failed to\nvisit or communicate with the child for a period of 6 months or longer.” Id.; see\nalso WIS. STAT. § 48.31(1).\n\n       ¶26     The legislature has also included a defense to abandonment in WIS.\nSTAT. § 48.415(1)(c), which provides:\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Amanda cites Emer’s Camper Corral, LLC v. Alderman, 2020 WI 46, ¶15, 391\nWis. 2d 674, 943 N.W.2d 513, for the proposition that a circuit court’s decision on a motion for\ndirected verdict is upheld unless the court was “clearly wrong.” We note that our supreme court\nin Emer’s stated, “Where a circuit court grants a motion for a directed verdict, we will uphold\nthe circuit court’s decision unless the circuit court was clearly wrong.” Id. (emphasis added).\nBecause the circuit court did not grant Amanda’s motion for a directed verdict, we apply the\nstandard of review set forth in Warren v. American Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., 122 Wis. 2d 381, 384,\n361 N.W.2d 724 (Ct. App. 1984).\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f                                                                                  No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n                Abandonment is not established under par. (a)2.[9] or 3. if\n                the parent proves all of the following by a preponderance of\n                the evidence:\n\n                1. That the parent had good cause for having failed to visit\n                with the child throughout the time period specified in par.\n                (a)2. or 3., whichever is applicable.\n\n                2. That the parent had good cause for having failed to\n                communicate with the child throughout the time period\n                specified in par. (a)2. or 3., whichever is applicable.\n\n                3. If the parent proves good cause under subd. 2., including\n                good cause based on evidence that the child’s age or\n                condition would have rendered any communication with\n                the child meaningless, that one of the following occurred:\n\n                a. The parent communicated about the child with the person\n                or persons who had physical custody of the child during the\n                time period specified in par. (a)2. or 3., whichever is\n                applicable, or, if par. (a)2. is applicable, with the agency\n                responsible for the care of the child during the time period\n                specified in par. (a)2.\n\n                b. The parent had good cause for having failed to\n                communicate about the child with the person or persons\n                who had physical custody of the child or the agency\n                responsible for the care of the child throughout the time\n                period specified in par. (a)2. or 3., whichever is applicable.\n\n      ¶27       In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Smiths, we\nconclude that the circuit court did not err by denying Amanda’s motion for a\ndirected verdict as to the second abandonment period. Amanda contends that\nbecause Lisa and the GAL did not provide a “reasonable opportunity” for Amanda\n“to visit or communicate with Lauren,” there was “no credible evidence that could\nsupport the jury rejecting Amanda’s good cause defense” as to the second alleged\nperiod of abandonment. The record belies Amanda’s argument.\n\n\n\n      9\n          Abandonment under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)2. is not at issue in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶28    Specifically, Amanda acknowledged that, during this time period,\nshe had no contact with Lauren and sent only two emails to Lisa despite testifying\nthat she knew Lisa’s home address, had Lisa’s phone number, and knew Lisa’s\nemail address. Lisa testified that she has lived at the same address since 2007, that\nshe has had the same phone number for over 30 years, and that she has had the\nsame email addresses since 2014. Lisa also testified that she had never blocked\nAmanda on her cell phone and that she believed she had responded to every email\nthat Amanda sent her. Further, Lisa denied interfering with Amanda’s efforts to\nsee Lauren and she stated that it was Amanda’s responsibility to schedule visits\nwith Lauren, which Amanda failed to do.\n\n       ¶29    While there appears to be no evidence explaining why the GAL did\nnot reply to Amanda’s emails, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the Smiths, there was evidence to support a jury finding that Amanda did not\nhave good cause for failing to visit or contact Lauren during this time period. A\njury could reasonably conclude that Amanda was not credible, or at least she was\nless credible than the Smiths. Making such a finding, the jury could further find\nthat Amanda did not make a good faith effort to communicate with Lauren, the\nGAL, or Lisa; that Amanda failed to prove that the Smiths interfered with her\nability to communicate and visit with Lauren; or that Amanda did not have good\ncause for failing to communicate and visit with Lauren. Simply put, there were\nfactual disputes regarding Amanda’s good cause defense during the second alleged\nperiod of abandonment. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by denying\nAmanda’s motion for a directed verdict. See Millonig, 112 Wis. 2d at 449.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\nII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n      ¶30       Amanda argues that the jury instructions and special verdict form on\nthe ground of abandonment violated her statutory and constitutional rights to a\nverdict by five-sixths of the jury because they failed to require the jury to\nseparately determine whether she abandoned Lauren during each specific time\nperiod alleged. As she did not raise this issue directly in the circuit court, it is\ntherefore forfeited, see WIS. STAT. § 805.13(3). She contends, however, her trial\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the instructions and\nverdict form.\n\n      ¶31       A parent in a TPR action has the right to be represented by effective\ncounsel, and a parent may therefore assert an ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim in a TPR action. See A.S. v. State, 168 Wis. 2d 995, 1003-05, 485 N.W.2d\n52 (1992).      A claim for the ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed\nquestions of law and fact. State v. Edward Johnson, 153 Wis. 2d 121, 127, 449\nN.W.2d 845 (1990). The circuit court’s findings of fact will not be overturned\nunless clearly erroneous. Id. “The ultimate determination of whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient and prejudicial … are questions of law which this court\nreviews independently.” Id., at 128.\n\n      ¶32       To demonstrate that counsel was ineffective, a party asserting the\nineffective claim must prove both that counsel’s performance was deficient and\nthat the deficient performance was prejudicial. See Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668, 687 (1984). If the party asserting the ineffective claim parent fails to\nsatisfy either prong of this test, we need not consider the other. See State v.\nBreitzman, 2017 WI 100, ¶37, 378 Wis. 2d 431, 904 N.W.2d 93. “[A]n attorney\nis not deficient for failing to pursue an ‘unsettled proposition of law.’” State v.\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                                No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nRobinson, 2024 WI App 50, ¶32, 413 Wis. 2d 534, 12 N.W.3d 535 (citation\nomitted).\n\n       ¶33     Amanda contends that the circuit court erred by concluding that the\nlaw on this issue is not settled and thereby denying her ineffective assistance\nclaim. She asserts that her counsel performed deficiently both by failing to ask the\ncircuit court to instruct the jury to answer separate questions related to each\nclaimed abandonment period and by not objecting to the court’s failure to provide\nthe jury with separate verdict forms as to each claimed abandonment period. She\nasserts that the law on this issue is well settled because the comments to the jury\ninstruction on abandonment under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)(3) state that in cases\nwhere multiple periods of abandonment are alleged, counsel should “be alert to\nnotice issues and separating the claims,” WIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018) (Period of\nAbandonment; Different Intervals), and because the five-sixths jury verdict\nrequirement “is well-established.”\n\n       ¶34     We conclude that the law is unsettled as to whether separate\ninstructions and verdict forms are required when more than one period of\nabandonment is alleged in a TPR action. In Heather T.C. v. Donald M.H.,\nNo. 2010AP467, unpublished slip op., ¶15 (WI App Feb. 1, 2012), this court\nspecifically noted that “[w]hile in the future Wisconsin law may clarify whether\nseparate instructions and separate verdicts are required when more than one period\nof abandonment is alleged, we have found no clear law that would have required\nthis at the time of the jury instruction and verdict conference in this case.”10 Our\n\n\n       10\n           Unpublished opinions authored by a single judge and issued on or after July 1, 2009,\nmay be cited for their persuasive value. See WIS. STAT. RULE 809.23(3)(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f                                                                                No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nsearch of the caselaw has not revealed any subsequent clarification on this issue.\nFurther, Amanda ignores that the jury instruction comment she cites also states\nthat “‘no clear law’ exists to clarify whether separate instructions and separate\nverdicts are required when more than one period of abandonment is alleged.”\nWIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018).\n\n         ¶35   While there is a statutory and constitutional right to a verdict by at\nleast five-sixths of the jury, see WIS. STAT. § 805.09(2); WIS. CONST. art. I, § 5,\nthe law is unclear as to whether failing to provide instructions and a verdict\nrequiring that the jury differentiate between periods of abandonment violates that\nright.     We therefore conclude that Amanda’s counsel did not render\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object to the circuit court’s\ninstructions and verdict form, and the court did not err by denying Amanda’s\npostdisposition motion on this issue.\n\nIII. Plain Error\n\n         ¶36   Alternatively, Amanda argues that the claimed errors in this case\nregarding the jury instruction and verdict form should be reviewed for plain error.\nThe plain error doctrine is codified in WIS. STAT. § 901.03(4) and provides,\n“Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial\nrights although they were not brought to the attention of the judge.” “The plain\nerror doctrine allows appellate courts to review errors that were otherwise\n[forfeited] by a party’s failure to object.” State v. Jorgensen, 2008 WI 60, ¶21,\n310 Wis. 2d 138, 754 N.W.2d 77.\n\n               Plain error is “error so fundamental that a new trial or other\n               relief must be granted even though the action was not\n               objected to at the time.” The error, however, must be\n               “obvious and substantial.” Courts should use the plain\n               error doctrine sparingly. For example, “where a basic\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f                                                                                   No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n                constitutional right has not been extended to the accused,”\n                the plain error doctrine should be utilized.\n\nId. (citations omitted). “[T]he existence of plain error will turn on the facts of the\nparticular case.” Id., ¶22 (citation omitted). If the proponent of the plain error\nshows that the unobjected-to error is fundamental, obvious, and substantial, the\nburden shifts to the beneficiary of the error to show that the error was harmless.\nSee id., ¶23.\n\n       ¶37      The resolution of Amanda’s claims requires us to interpret statutes\nand to determine whether jury instructions state the applicable law correctly, both\nof which are questions of law that we review de novo. State v. Stewart, 2018 WI\nApp 41, ¶18, 383 Wis. 2d 546, 916 N.W.2d 188; State v. Langlois, 2018 WI 73,\n¶34, 382 Wis. 2d 414, 913 N.W.2d 812. “[S]tatutory interpretation ‘begins with\nthe language of the statute. If the meaning of the statute is plain, we ordinarily\nstop the inquiry.’ Statutory language is given its common, ordinary, and accepted\nmeaning, except that technical or specially-defined words or phrases are given\ntheir technical or special definitional meaning.” State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Ct.\nfor Dane Cnty., 2004 WI 58, ¶45, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110 (citations\nomitted).\n\n                Context is important to meaning. So, too, is the structure of\n                the statute in which the operative language appears.\n                Therefore, statutory language is interpreted in the context\n                in which it is used; not in isolation but as part of a whole; in\n                relation to the language of surrounding or closely-related\n                statutes; and reasonably, to avoid absurd or unreasonable\n                results.\n\nId., ¶46. “If this process of analysis yields a plain, clear statutory meaning, then\nthere is no ambiguity, and the statute is applied according to this ascertainment of\nits meaning.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶38   “‘Termination of parental rights’ means that, pursuant to a court\norder, all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties and obligations existing\nbetween parent and child are permanently severed.” WIS. STAT. § 48.40(2). TPR\nproceedings “are among the most consequential of judicial acts, involving as they\ndo ‘the awesome authority of the State to destroy permanently all legal recognition\nof the parental relationship.’” Steven V. v. Kelley H., 2004 WI 47, ¶21, 271\nWis. 2d 1, 678 N.W.2d 856 (citation omitted). Because of this, TPR proceedings\n“deserve ‘heightened’ due process protections.” Dane Cnty. DHS v. Susan P. S.,\n2006 WI App 100, ¶51 n.5, 293 Wis. 2d 279, 715 N.W.2d 692 (citation omitted);\nBrown County v. Shannon R., 2005 WI 160, ¶59, 286 Wis. 2d 278, 706 N.W.2d\n269.\n\n       ¶39   “A parent’s interest in the parent-child relationship and in the care,\ncustody, and management of his or her child is recognized as a fundamental liberty\ninterest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Steven V., 271 Wis. 2d 1, ¶22.\n“Thus, due process requires that ‘[w]hen the State moves to destroy weakened\nfamilial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.’”\nId., ¶23 (citation omitted). These “fundamentally fair procedures” include the\nrequirement of proving parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. Id.\n\n       ¶40   A circuit court is required to find a parent unfit if a statutory ground\nfor TPR is found by the court or by a jury. WIS. STAT. § 48.424(4). The grounds\nfor TPR are set forth in WIS. STAT. § 48.415, and the Smiths argued that Amanda\nabandoned Lauren under § 48.415(1)(a)3. As relevant to the issues here, that\nstatute required the Smiths to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that\nAmanda failed to visit or communicate with Lauren for a period of six months or\nlonger. See id. Further, as relevant here and discussed above, § 48.415(1)(c)\nprovides that abandonment is not established if the parent proves he or she has\n\n                                        18\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\ngood cause, as defined in the statute, for failing to visit or communicate with the\nchild or the child’s physical custodian during the alleged abandonment period.\nSee supra ¶26.\n\n       ¶41    A parent in a TPR proceeding has the right to a twelve-person jury\nduring the grounds phase of the TPR process. WIS. STAT. § 48.31(1), (2). Section\n48.31(2) further provides that WIS. STAT. chs. 756 and 805 “shall govern the\nselection of jurors.” WISCONSIN STAT. § 805.09(2) in turn provides, “A verdict\nagreed to by five-sixths of the jurors shall be the verdict of the jury. If more than\none question must be answered to arrive at a verdict on the same claim, the same\nfive-sixths of the jurors must agree on all the questions.” This rule, colloquially\nreferred to as the “five-sixths rule,” “requires that the same ten jurors must agree\non all questions necessary to support a judgment on a particular claim.”\nNommensen v. American Cont’l Ins. Co., 2000 WI App 230, ¶18, 239 Wis. 2d\n129, 619 N.W.2d 137. Although the right to a jury trial at the grounds phase of a\nTPR proceeding “is entirely statutory” and “not mandated by constitutional due\nprocess,” Steven V., 271 Wis. 2d 1, ¶34, the right to a verdict by at least five-\nsixths of the jury stems from our state constitution. See WIS. CONST. art. I, § 5\n(“[T]he legislature may, from time to time, by statute provide that a valid verdict,\nin civil cases, may be based on the votes of a specified number of the jury, not less\nthan five-sixths thereof.”).\n\n       ¶42    Amanda argues that the circuit court deprived her of her statutory\nand constitutional rights to a five-sixths jury verdict by failing to require that the\njury agree on all questions necessary to support its verdict that she abandoned\nLauren. Specifically, Amanda contends that by not instructing the jury to consider\neach alleged period of abandonment independently and failing to provide separate\nverdict forms for each abandonment period, she was deprived of her right to have\n\n                                         19\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nthe same ten jurors agree on all questions necessary to support a judgment on each\nclaimed abandonment period.              We agree, and given Amanda’s fundamental,\nobvious, and substantial rights at issue in this TPR proceeding, coupled with her\nstatutory right to a five-sixths verdict, we conclude that the court’s failure to\nprovide the jury with separate instructions and verdicts for each alleged period of\nabandonment constituted plain error.11\n\n        ¶43     We begin with our review of the plain language of the statute.\nBased on that review, we interpret WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. and the WIS JI—\nCHILDREN 314 (2018) model verdict questions12 to refer to a single period of\nabandonment. Particularly, both § 48.415(1)(a)3. and question 3 of the model\nverdict questions ask if a parent failed to meet or communicate with his or her\nchild “for a period of 6 months or longer”—meaning one singular period.\nSec. 48.415(1)(a)3.; WIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018) (emphasis added). The next\nfour model verdict questions—questions 4 though 7—pertain to a parent’s defense\nto abandonment under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(c), and both the instructions and the\n\n\n\n\n        11\n           Because we conclude that failing to provide the jury with separate instructions and\nverdicts for each alleged period of abandonment was plain error, we need not address Amanda’s\nargument that that she is entitled to reversal in the interest of justice. See Turner v. Taylor, 2003\nWI App 256, ¶1 n.1, 268 Wis. 2d 628, 673 N.W.2d 716 (noting that we need not address all\nissues when the resolution of one of those issues is dispositive).\n        12\n            The model verdict form for abandonment under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. currently\nconsists of seven questions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f                                                                                  No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nquestions refer back to that singular period from question 3. WIS JI—CHILDREN\n314 (2018).13\n\n        ¶44     Here, the circuit court’s failure to instruct the jury to consider a\nsingular period for each set of verdict questions and its failure to provide the jury\nwith separate verdict forms for each alleged period of abandonment resulted in the\njury failing to consider each alleged abandonment period separately and deprived\nAmanda of her right to a five-sixths verdict on each separate time period. Based\nupon the jury instructions and verdict form, we cannot determine if the same five-\nsixths of the jurors found that Amanda abandoned Lauren during one of the\nalleged periods, both of the alleged periods, or some combination of the two.\n\n        ¶45     In fact, the circuit court recognized this possibility. In finding that\nthe instructions and verdict form were sufficient, the court concluded that even if\nonly five jurors agreed on the first time period, and only five jurors agreed on the\nsecond time period, “this means 10 jurors (five-sixths) found the mother\nabandoned her child.” The court stated, “In a TPR trial, the ultimate question the\njury must answer is: did the parent abandon her child, not when did the parent\nabandon her child.” The Smiths echo this analysis, claiming the same five-sixths\nof the jury needed only to determine that Amanda “abandoned” Lauren and do not\nneed to agree as to when that occurred.\n\n\n        13\n           The jury instructions state that “[q]uestions 4-7 apply to the period of six months or\nlonger as determined in question 3.” These questions ask (4) “Did (parent) have good cause for\nhaving failed to visit with (child) during that period?,” (5) “Did (parent) have good cause for\nhaving failed to communicate with (child) during that period?,” (6) “Did (parent) communicate\nabout (child) with the (person) (persons) who had physical custody of the child during that\nperiod?,” and (7) “Did (parent) have good cause for having failed to communicate about (child)\nwith the (person) (persons) having physical custody during that period?” WIS JI—CHILDREN 314\n(2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶46     We conclude this analysis ignores the plain wording of the statute.\nAs Amanda argues, “the question of ‘when’ [she] allegedly failed to visit and\ncommunicate with Lauren is inherent to the question of ‘whether’ she abandoned\nLauren, because the definition of abandonment contains a ‘when’ question—a\nspecific ‘period of 6 months or longer.’” See WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. This\nstatutory manner of defining the grounds of “abandonment” is critical.           The\nprejudicial effect of the generalized verdict is further amplified where, as was the\ncase here, two jurors dissented from the majority’s verdict. If even one of the\nremaining ten jurors based his or her decision on a different period than the rest of\nthe jurors, the verdict did not meet the five-sixths requirement.\n\n       ¶47     We further note that following the circuit court’s rationale, a jury\ncould find abandonment by determining that Amanda failed to visit or\ncommunicate with Lauren during six individual nonconsecutive months over a\nperiod of years. This result would clearly be contrary to the statute’s wording\nrequiring the jury to determine whether the parent has failed to visit or\ncommunicate with the child “for a period of 6 months or longer.” See id. We\nconclude that this wording evidences the legislature’s clear intent that a single,\nprolonged period of abandonment is required before a parent’s fundamental rights\nare severed.\n\n       ¶48     Although the jury did not address questions five through seven of the\nverdict, had they done so using a single verdict, we would be unable to determine\nwhether five-sixths of the jury agreed that Amanda had good cause, or lacked\ngood cause, in failing to visit or communicate with Lauren during the same time\nperiod. This inability is particularly problematic where, as here, a parent argues\ndiffering good cause defenses to the alleged periods of abandonment. Thus, where\nthere are multiple alleged periods of abandonment, the jury must be instructed to\n\n                                         22\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nconsider each alleged period of abandonment separately and must be provided\nwith verdict forms as to each separate abandonment period alleged.\n\n       ¶49    In arguing to the contrary, the Smiths cite State v. William.\nJohnson, 2001 WI 52, 243 Wis. 2d 365, 627 N.W.2d 455, a criminal case the\ncircuit court relied upon and that the Smiths characterize as being applicable to\nTPR cases. There, the defendant was charged with repeated sexual assault of the\nsame child based on the victim’s testimony that the defendant assaulted her\nmultiple times during the summer of 1997. Id., ¶4. Among other elements, the\njury was instructed that the State was required to prove that “at least three of the\nalleged sexual assaults took place from a specific period of time,” with that period\nbeing the summer of 1997. Id., ¶7. However, the applicable statute expressly\nstated that the jury must unanimously agree that at least three sexual assaults\noccurred, but it need not agree on which acts constituted the requisite number. Id.,\n¶8. The defendant was convicted and subsequently moved for a new trial, arguing\nthat his right to a unanimous verdict had been violated because “the State\nintroduced evidence of more than the minimum number of sexual assaults required\nto constitute the crime, but the jury was not instructed that it had to agree\nunanimously on the specific acts of sexual assault before convicting him.” Id., ¶9.\n\n       ¶50    Our supreme court rejected the defendant’s argument. Id., ¶28. The\ncourt noted that “when the statute in question establishes different modes or means\nby which the offense may be committed, unanimity is generally not required on\nthe alternate modes or means of commission.” Id., ¶11. Applying this test, the\ncourt concluded, “Where evidence of more than three acts is admitted, the jury\nneed not unanimously agree about the underlying acts as long as it unanimously\nagrees that the defendant committed at least three.” Id., ¶15. “In other words, it is\nthe course of sexually assaultive conduct that constitutes the primary element of\n\n                                         23\n\f                                                                                    No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nthis offense, about which the jury must be unanimous…. Unanimity is explicitly\nnot required regarding the individual acts of sexual assault.” Id., ¶16\n\n        ¶51     The court further stated:\n\n                [T]he violations of the law about which the jury need not\n                be unanimous under this statutory scheme all involve the\n                sexual abuse of children, crimes of the same or similar\n                nature and level of culpability. It is therefore not unfair or\n                irrational to lift the requirement of jury unanimity as to the\n                specific underlying acts as long as unanimity is required\n                regarding the existence of the course of conduct.\n\nId., ¶19.\n\n        ¶52     Applying the same logic from the William. Johnson court, the\ncircuit court found—and the Smiths argue on appeal—that “[t]he five-sixths\nthreshold is met upon the jury returning a finding of abandonment—that is all the\nlaw requires the jury to decide.            The law does not require deciding alleged\nmultiple periods of abandonment separately, nor does it require multiple periods to\nbe presented to the jury separately.”\n\n        ¶53     We consider this analogy inapt.14                Here, unlike WIS. STAT.\n§ 948.025(2), the course of conduct necessary to support a judgment on a claim for\nabandonment—i.e., one of the essential elements—is a period of abandonment of\nsix or more months.          The legislature has recognized the fundamental rights\n\n\n        14\n          The circuit court also considered whether separate jury instructions and verdict forms\nwere needed by comparing this issue to the context of party-to-a-crime liability, in that there are\n“various ways a person might be guilty as a party to a crime without requiring the jurors to agree\non the applicable theory or theories.” See Holland v. State, 91 Wis. 2d 134, 143, 280 N.W.2d\n288 (1979). We do not find this reasoning persuasive, as there is no allegation here that the time\nelement of abandonment can be proven in a variety of ways; it can only be proven if a child is\nabandoned for a period of six months or more.\n\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\naffected by TPR proceedings, and, in order to terminate those rights, it requires\nproof that a parent abandoned his or her child under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3.\nfor a period of at least six months. Further, the legislature has provided a parent\nwith the opportunity to present a defense of good cause, the facts of which are\nspecifically related to each period of abandonment alleged. In other words, based\nupon our interpretation of WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3, we conclude that in order to\npermanently destroy all legal recognition of the parental relationship, five-sixths\nof the jury must agree on one period of abandonment, and the same five-sixths of\nthe jury must agree that the parent did not have good cause for failing to visit or\ncommunicate with the child or his or her custodian during that abandonment\nperiod.\n\n       ¶54    The Smiths also contrast abandonment under WIS. STAT.\n§ 48.415(1)(a)3. with the finding of dangerousness required to have a person\ninvoluntarily committed under WIS. STAT. § 51.20. The Smiths note that circuit\ncourts must make specific factual findings regarding a subject’s dangerousness in\norder to clearly track the necessary elements for involuntary commitment. See\nLanglade County v. D.J.W., 2020 WI 41, 391 Wis. 2d 231, 942 N.W.2d 277;\nSheboygan County v. M.W., 2022 WI 40, ¶11, 402 Wis. 2d 1, 974 N.W.2d 733\n(quoting the court of appeals decision that the circuit court “failed to clearly track\nthe necessary elements of any particular subdivision paragraph and state how the\nevidence satisfied those elements.”).         The Smiths assert that there is no\nsubcategorization of types of abandonment in § 48.415(1)(a)3. as there is for the\ntypes of dangerousness in § 51.20; instead, § 48.415(1)(a)3. has “a singular\nevidentiary threshold.” From these differences, they contend that the jury need not\ndifferentiate between periods of abandonment in reaching its decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n         ¶55   We are not persuaded.          Abandonment under WIS. STAT.\n§ 48.415(1)(a)3. does not have a singular evidentiary threshold as the Smiths\nsuggest. Rather, there is a secondary evidentiary threshold concerning the parent’s\nright to present a good cause defense to abandonment under § 48.415(1)(c), and\nthat statute provides multiple ways in which a parent can prove a good cause\ndefense. This defense not only directly corresponds to the specific alleged period\nof abandonment, but it also has a different evidentiary burden. See WIS. STAT.\n§ 48.31(1) (stating that the grounds under § 48.415 must be proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence); § 48.415(1)(c) (stating that a parent must prove his or her\ndefense to abandonment by a preponderance of the evidence).\n\n         ¶56   Regardless, as stated above, in order to find abandonment when\nmultiple time periods are alleged, we interpret WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3 as\nrequiring that five-sixths of the jury agree both on a period of abandonment and\nthat the parent did not have good cause for failing to visit or communicate with the\nchild or his or her custodian during that specific abandonment period in order for\nthere to be grounds for TPR. The circuit court’s failure to provide the jury with\ninstructions and verdict forms that complied with these statutory requirements,\nthereby depriving Amanda of her right to a five-sixths verdict, constituted plain\nerror.\n\nIV. Harmless Error.\n\n         ¶57   Having concluded that the failure to provide the jury with separate\ninstructions and special verdict forms for each alleged period of abandonment was\na fundamental, obvious, and substantial error, the burden now shifts to the Smiths\nto show that the error was harmless. See Jorgensen, 310 Wis. 2d 138, ¶23; State\nv. Dyess, 124 Wis. 2d 525, 543, 370 N.W.2d 222 (1985). “The standard for\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nharmless error is the same for civil and criminal cases. The test is whether there is\na reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the outcome of the action or\nproceeding at issue.” Schwigel v. Kohlmann, 2005 WI App 44, ¶11, 280 Wis. 2d\n193, 694 N.W.2d 467.\n\n       ¶58    The Smiths do little in trying to meet their burden. They “contend\nthat any such error is appropriately deemed harmless.” They further assert that\n“[t]he record does not support, and Amanda fails to present, any evidence\ndemonstrating the jury’s verdict was unreliable, or that any juror could have\nreached a different conclusion had the alleged error not occurred.”\n\n       ¶59    In making this argument, the Smiths ignore that they have the\nburden to prove harmless error. In addition, they fail to address the clear violation\nof Amanda’s right to a five-sixths jury verdict. As discussed above, the circuit\ncourt’s failure to properly instruct the jury and provide separate verdicts for each\nalleged abandonment period prevents us from determining if the same five-sixths\nof the jurors found that Amanda abandoned Lauren during one six-month time\nperiod. There is a reasonable possibility that these errors contributed to the jury’s\nfinding of abandonment. Further, it is possible that the jury may have found\nAmanda had good cause for failing to communicate with or visit Lauren if the jury\nhad been asked to consider each period of abandonment separately. We therefore\nconclude that the circuit court’s failure to properly instruct the jury and provide\nseparate verdicts for each alleged period of abandonment was not harmless.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶60    A parent’s failure to visit or communicate with his or her child for a\nperiod of six months or longer is an essential element of abandonment under WIS.\nSTAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. When multiple periods of abandonment are alleged, that\n\n                                         27\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nstatute requires the jury must be instructed to consider each period of\nabandonment separately, and the jury must be provided with a separate verdict\nform for each period of abandonment. As this area of the law was previously\nunsettled, Amanda’s counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to question the\njury instructions and verdict form. We now conclude, however, that the circuit\ncourt’s failure to properly instruct the jury and provide separate verdict forms for\neach abandonment period alleged deprived Amanda of her right to a five-sixths\nverdict, constituting plain error. We further conclude that such error was not\nharmless. We therefore reverse the court’s order terminating Amanda’s parental\nrights to Lauren and the order denying Amanda’s postdisposition motion, and we\nremand with directions for a new factfinding hearing consistent with this decision.\n\n              By the Court.—Orders reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n              Recommended for publication in the official reports.\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f\f",

The matter was tried to a twelve-person jury, which\nwas instructed that there were two abandonment periods at issue, but it was not\ninstructed that it should separately consider each period of abandonment when\nanswering the verdict questions. The jury found that Amanda had abandoned\nLauren, but the verdict form did not permit the jurors to specify the period or\nperiods of abandonment on which they agreed. Amanda therefore argues that she\nwas deprived of her statutory and constitutional rights to a verdict by five-sixths of\n\n\n        1\n         Pursuant to WIS. STAT. § 752.31 (2023-24), cases under WIS. STAT. ch. 48 (2023-24)\nare decided by one judge. However, upon reviewing the briefs in this matter, this court\ndetermined that an issue raised by the appellant warranted consideration by three judges and\nsubsequently sua sponte ordered that this case be decided by three judges. See WIS. STAT.\nRULE 809.41(3) (2023-24).\n\n        All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2023-24 version.\n\n        Cases appealed under WIS. STAT. RULE 809.107 are “given preference and shall be taken\nin an order that ensures that a decision is issued within 30 days after the filing of the appellant’s\nreply.” RULE 809.107(6)(e). Conversion to a three-judge panel, in conjunction with conflicts in\nthis court’s calendar, has resulted in a delay. It is therefore necessary for this court to sua sponte\nextend the deadline for a decision in this case. See WIS. STAT. RULE 809.82(2)(a); Rhonda R.D.\nv.

We do the same for the child, the child’s biological father,\nand the child’s guardians.\n\n        We note that Amanda’s notice of appeal was taken from the order terminating her\nparental rights. During the pendency of her appeal, Amanda filed a postdisposition motion. We\ngranted a stay for the circuit court to decide the postdisposition motion, then granted Amanda’s\nmotion to extend the time for filing the statement on the transcript. As a result, we consider both\nthe order terminating Amanda’s parental rights and the order denying her postdisposition motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                                                                                   No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nthe jury on each of the alleged TPR elements during the grounds phase of the TPR\nprocess.3\n\n        ¶2      Amanda failed to raise this issue in the circuit court, and she\ntherefore claims that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to\nobject to the jury instruction and verdict form. Because this issue is one of first\nimpression in Wisconsin, we affirm the circuit court’s conclusion that trial counsel\ndid not perform deficiently by failing to object to the jury instruction and verdict\nform, as the law on this issue is unsettled.\n\n        ¶3      We further affirm the circuit court’s denial of Amanda’s motion for\na directed verdict after the close of the evidence, as viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the guardians, there was sufficient evidence of Amanda’s\nabandonment to permit the jury to decide the issue.\n\n        ¶4      We conclude, however, that both the circuit court’s failure to instruct\nthe jury that it must consider each period of abandonment separately when\nanswering the verdict and the court’s use of a special verdict form that failed to\nspecify during which period or periods Amanda was alleged to have abandoned\nLauren constituted plain error. This is because these errors deprived Amanda of\nher obvious and substantial right to a verdict by five-sixths of the jury on each of\nthe elements of abandonment. Whenever multiple periods of abandonment are\nalleged at trial, the jury instructions and verdict forms must require the jury to\n\n        3\n           A contested TPR proceeding involves a two-step procedure.

In\nSeptember 2014, when Lauren was approximately four and one-half years old, she\nwas found to be a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS), and was\nremoved from Amanda’s care due to Amanda’s struggles with alcoholism. Lauren\nwas placed with Lisa and Shawn Smith, Lauren’s maternal aunt and her husband.\nAmanda was unsuccessful in completing the conditions for Lauren’s return home,\nand in 2017, the Smiths were granted guardianship of Lauren over Amanda’s\nobjection.\n\n       ¶6        In July 2019, the Smiths filed a petition for the termination of\nAmanda’s and Matthew’s parental rights, alleging grounds of abandonment and\nfailure to assume parental responsibility under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1) and (6),\nrespectively. Amanda and Matthew4 exercised their right to a jury trial during the\ngrounds phase of the TPR process. See WIS. STAT. § 48.422(4).\n\n       ¶7        As relevant to this appeal, the Smiths argued at trial that Amanda\nabandoned        Lauren      during      two     separate      six-month      periods:     from\n\n\n\n       4\n           Matthew is not participating in this appeal. We do not mention him further.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nNovember 1, 2017, to May 1, 2018; and from January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2019.\nWe briefly summarize the trial testimony pertinent to these allegations.\n\n         ¶8        Regarding the first alleged period of abandonment, Amanda testified\nthat from November 2017 to May 2018, she was living in Green Bay and Lauren\nwas residing with the Smiths.5 Amanda stated that while she did not have any\ncontact with Lauren during this time period, she did communicate with Lisa via\nemail, and she asserted that her lack of direct contact with Lauren was not her\nfault.\n\n         ¶9        Amanda testified that prior to the guardianship, i.e., from\nSeptember 2014 to April 2017, she was very involved in Lauren’s life. Amanda\nexplained that she had frequent visits with Lauren, both supervised and\nunsupervised. Many of Amanda’s supervised visits with Lauren took place at the\nBeacon Center, a supervised visitation center that was offered as a service to\nAmanda by the Brown County Department of Health and Human Services\n(DHHS). When the guardianship was granted, DHHS stopped providing services\nto Amanda, including use of the Beacon Center for visits with Lauren.\n\n         ¶10       Amanda testified that thereafter, Lisa began to exclude her from\ncontact with Lauren and from participating in Lauren’s activities. For example,\nAmanda was told she was no longer welcome to attend Lauren’s gymnastic\nclasses, and Lisa prohibited her from having lunch with Lauren at her school.\nAmanda stated that after the guardianship was granted, she attempted to establish\na visitation schedule through Lisa, but Lisa denied visitation on all the days that\n\n\n         5\n             Lisa testified that she and Shawn were residing in Green Bay at this time.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nAmanda requested, and the Smiths did not allow her any visits with Lauren.\nFurther, Lisa did not update Amanda on Lauren’s activities during the\nguardianship, which Lisa had agreed to do.\n\n       ¶11    Amanda testified that she emailed Lisa on April 22, 2018, asking to\nsee Lauren, noting that Lisa had not been returning her calls or texts and that she\nwas not being allowed to see Lauren at school. Amanda included her then-current\nphone number in the email, and the email was received into evidence. Amanda\ndid not recall Lisa responding to that email.\n\n       ¶12    Lisa testified that, after the guardianship was ordered, it was\nAmanda’s responsibility to contact her and schedule visits with Lauren. Lisa\nacknowledged that under the guardianship order, she was required to keep\nAmanda updated on Lauren’s extracurricular activities and she admitted she did\nnot always do so. Lisa stated that her relationship with Amanda became “a little\ndifficult” after the guardianship was ordered and that they then began to\ncommunicate with each other exclusively by email. Lisa testified that Amanda’s\nApril 22, 2018 email was the first time she heard from Amanda after the\nguardianship was ordered in April 2017, and she stated there was no contact\nbetween Amanda and Lauren in 2018 or 2019.\n\n       ¶13    Lisa denied interfering with Lauren and Amanda’s relationship. She\ntestified that she believed she responded to every email she received from\nAmanda. She acknowledged that she did take a lot of weekend trips but stated she\ndid not do so to keep Lauren from Amanda. She also denied sending a letter to\nLauren’s school saying that Amanda could not visit Lauren there.\n\n       ¶14    In May 2018, Amanda filed a petition to terminate the guardianship,\narguing that good cause existed to remove the Smiths as guardians and that there\n\n                                          6\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nhad been a substantial change in her circumstances. In August 2018, Amanda also\nfiled a petition to revise the guardianship order. These petitions were resolved\nthrough mediation with Amanda, the Smiths, and a guardian ad litem (GAL). The\nparties agreed that Amanda and Lauren would both see counselors and that the\nGAL would check on their progress to see if they could participate in therapy\ntogether.    Lauren’s therapist would decide when Lauren was ready to be\nreintroduced to Amanda.\n\n       ¶15    Regarding the second alleged period of abandonment, Amanda\ntestified that from January 2019 to July 2019, she continued to live in Green Bay,\nwhere Lauren continued residing with the Smiths. Amanda acknowledged that she\ndid not have any contact with Lauren during this period. However, Amanda\ntestified that she sent several emails to Lisa during this period asking for updates\non Lauren, asking whether she could purchase things for Lauren, and sending\nLauren birthday wishes.     Amanda also discussed, and entered into evidence,\nemails that she sent on January 29, 2019, and March 13, 2019, to her prior counsel\nand Lauren’s GAL asking for information on the status of Lauren’s counseling and\nattempting to schedule an appointment with Lauren’s therapist. Amanda stated\nthat she never received a response from the GAL or her counsel regarding her\nrequests to establish counseling with Lauren.\n\n       ¶16    Lisa acknowledged that she received emails from Amanda in\nJanuary and February 2019, and she stated that she responded to some of those\nemails. Aside from the emails, Lisa testified that she did not have any contact\nwith Amanda from January 1, 2019, through July 1, 2019. Lisa reiterated that it\nwas her understanding that Amanda remained responsible for scheduling visits\nwith Lauren both before and after the guardianship was ordered.\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                                                                      No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶17    After the Smiths rested their case, Amanda moved for a directed\nverdict as to both of the alleged periods of abandonment as grounds for the TPR.\nAmanda contended that there was not any “legally sufficient evidentiary basis for\na reasonable jury to reach a different conclusion other than she has not abandoned\nher child” during either timeframe because the emails presented at trial showed\nthat she communicated with Lisa during the alleged periods of abandonment. The\ncircuit court found there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Amanda\nabandoned Lauren, and it denied Amanda’s motion as to both of the abandonment\nperiods.\n\n       ¶18    Relevant to the ground of abandonment, the circuit court instructed\nthe jury that the special verdict would be comprised of seven questions. For the\nfirst three questions, the burden was on the Smiths to prove those elements “by\nevidence that is clear, satisfactory and convincing to a reasonable certainty,” and\nfor the remaining four questions, the burden was on Amanda to prove those\nelements “by the greater weight of the credible evidence to a reasonable\ncertainty.”\n\n       ¶19    The circuit court then advised the jury that the TPR petition alleged\nthat Amanda abandoned Lauren “for the time period of November 1, 2017, to\nMay 1, 2018,” and that the petition also alleged “that [Lauren] has been\nabandoned from the time period of January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2019.” Regarding\nAmanda’s defense to abandonment, the court instructed the jury that it had to\ndetermine whether Amanda “had a reasonable opportunity to visit or communicate\nwith [Lauren] or communicate with the persons who had physical custody of\n[Lauren] during that period.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f                                                                               No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶20      The jury answered “Yes” to questions one, two and, three on the\nspecial verdict form, which asked, respectively, “Was [Lauren] left by [Amanda]\nwith a relative or other person?,” “Did [Amanda] know, or could she have\ndiscovered, [Lauren’s] whereabouts?,” and “Did [Amanda] fail to visit or\ncommunicate with [Lauren] for a period of 6 months or longer?” Question four\nasked, “Did [Amanda] have good cause for having failed to visit with [Lauren]\nduring that period?,” which the jury answered, “No.” Because the jury answered\n“No” to question four, the remaining questions were intentionally left blank. 6 See\nWIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018). Two jurors dissented from the abandonment\nverdict. The jury also returned a verdict finding that Amanda did not fail to\nassume parental responsibility for Lauren.\n\n       ¶21      During the dispositional phase of the TPR process, the circuit court\nentered an order terminating Amanda’s parental rights to Lauren after determining\nthat it would be in Lauren’s best interests to do so.               Amanda then filed a\npostdisposition motion to vacate the TPR order, arguing that she was denied\nconstitutionally effective assistance of counsel based on her counsel’s failure to\nobject to the jury instructions and verdict form because they failed to require the\njury to separately consider whether she abandoned Lauren during each specific\ntime period alleged. After a Machner7 hearing, the circuit court denied Amanda’s\nmotion, stating that the issue Amanda argued “is still unsettled law” and that\n\n\n       6\n          Question five asked, “Did [Amanda] have good cause for having failed to communicate\nwith [Lauren] during that period?” Question six asked, “Did [Amanda] communicate about\n[Lauren] with the persons who had physical custody of the child during that period?” Question\nseven asked, “Did [Amanda] have good cause for having failed to communicate about [Lauren]\nwith the persons who had physical custody of the child?”\n       7\n           See State v.

Directed Verdict.\n\n         ¶22   We first address Amanda’s claim that the circuit court erred by\ndenying her motion for a directed verdict as to the second alleged period of\nabandonment.      Amanda contends that she had good cause for failing to\ncommunicate or visit with Lauren during the second abandonment period because\nthe GAL and Lisa prevented her from doing so and that “there is no credible\nevidence that could support the jury rejecting [her] good cause defense” for that\nalleged period of abandonment.\n\n         ¶23   A motion for a directed verdict is authorized under WIS. STAT.\n§ 805.14(4), which provides that after “the close of all evidence” during a jury\ntrial, “any party may challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of law\nby moving for directed verdict or dismissal or by moving the court to find as a\nmatter of law upon any claim or defense or upon any element or ground thereof.”\nDirected verdicts are permitted in civil proceedings, including TPR proceedings.\nDoor Cnty.

Amanda contends that\nbecause Lisa and the GAL did not provide a “reasonable opportunity” for Amanda\n“to visit or communicate with Lauren,” there was “no credible evidence that could\nsupport the jury rejecting Amanda’s good cause defense” as to the second alleged\nperiod of abandonment. The record belies Amanda’s argument.\n\n\n\n      9\n          Abandonment under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)2. is not at issue in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶28    Specifically, Amanda acknowledged that, during this time period,\nshe had no contact with Lauren and sent only two emails to Lisa despite testifying\nthat she knew Lisa’s home address, had Lisa’s phone number, and knew Lisa’s\nemail address. Lisa testified that she has lived at the same address since 2007, that\nshe has had the same phone number for over 30 years, and that she has had the\nsame email addresses since 2014. Lisa also testified that she had never blocked\nAmanda on her cell phone and that she believed she had responded to every email\nthat Amanda sent her. Further, Lisa denied interfering with Amanda’s efforts to\nsee Lauren and she stated that it was Amanda’s responsibility to schedule visits\nwith Lauren, which Amanda failed to do.\n\n       ¶29    While there appears to be no evidence explaining why the GAL did\nnot reply to Amanda’s emails, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the Smiths, there was evidence to support a jury finding that Amanda did not\nhave good cause for failing to visit or contact Lauren during this time period. A\njury could reasonably conclude that Amanda was not credible, or at least she was\nless credible than the Smiths. Making such a finding, the jury could further find\nthat Amanda did not make a good faith effort to communicate with Lauren, the\nGAL, or Lisa; that Amanda failed to prove that the Smiths interfered with her\nability to communicate and visit with Lauren; or that Amanda did not have good\ncause for failing to communicate and visit with Lauren. Simply put, there were\nfactual disputes regarding Amanda’s good cause defense during the second alleged\nperiod of abandonment. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by denying\nAmanda’s motion for a directed verdict.

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n      ¶30       Amanda argues that the jury instructions and special verdict form on\nthe ground of abandonment violated her statutory and constitutional rights to a\nverdict by five-sixths of the jury because they failed to require the jury to\nseparately determine whether she abandoned Lauren during each specific time\nperiod alleged. As she did not raise this issue directly in the circuit court, it is\ntherefore forfeited, see WIS. STAT. § 805.13(3). She contends, however, her trial\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the instructions and\nverdict form.\n\n      ¶31       A parent in a TPR action has the right to be represented by effective\ncounsel, and a parent may therefore assert an ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim in a TPR action.

She asserts that her counsel performed deficiently both by failing to ask the\ncircuit court to instruct the jury to answer separate questions related to each\nclaimed abandonment period and by not objecting to the court’s failure to provide\nthe jury with separate verdict forms as to each claimed abandonment period. She\nasserts that the law on this issue is well settled because the comments to the jury\ninstruction on abandonment under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)(3) state that in cases\nwhere multiple periods of abandonment are alleged, counsel should “be alert to\nnotice issues and separating the claims,” WIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018) (Period of\nAbandonment; Different Intervals), and because the five-sixths jury verdict\nrequirement “is well-established.”\n\n       ¶34     We conclude that the law is unsettled as to whether separate\ninstructions and verdict forms are required when more than one period of\nabandonment is alleged in a TPR action. In Heather T.C. v. Donald M.H.,\nNo. 2010AP467, unpublished slip op., ¶15 (WI App Feb. 1, 2012), this court\nspecifically noted that “[w]hile in the future Wisconsin law may clarify whether\nseparate instructions and separate verdicts are required when more than one period\nof abandonment is alleged, we have found no clear law that would have required\nthis at the time of the jury instruction and verdict conference in this case.”10 Our\n\n\n       10\n           Unpublished opinions authored by a single judge and issued on or after July 1, 2009,\nmay be cited for their persuasive value.

STAT. § 805.09(2); WIS. CONST. art. I, § 5,\nthe law is unclear as to whether failing to provide instructions and a verdict\nrequiring that the jury differentiate between periods of abandonment violates that\nright.     We therefore conclude that Amanda’s counsel did not render\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object to the circuit court’s\ninstructions and verdict form, and the court did not err by denying Amanda’s\npostdisposition motion on this issue.\n\nIII. Plain Error\n\n         ¶36   Alternatively, Amanda argues that the claimed errors in this case\nregarding the jury instruction and verdict form should be reviewed for plain error.\nThe plain error doctrine is codified in WIS. STAT. § 901.03(4) and provides,\n“Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial\nrights although they were not brought to the attention of the judge.” “The plain\nerror doctrine allows appellate courts to review errors that were otherwise\n[forfeited] by a party’s failure to object.” State v.

Specifically, Amanda contends that by not instructing the jury to consider\neach alleged period of abandonment independently and failing to provide separate\nverdict forms for each abandonment period, she was deprived of her right to have\n\n                                         19\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nthe same ten jurors agree on all questions necessary to support a judgment on each\nclaimed abandonment period.              We agree, and given Amanda’s fundamental,\nobvious, and substantial rights at issue in this TPR proceeding, coupled with her\nstatutory right to a five-sixths verdict, we conclude that the court’s failure to\nprovide the jury with separate instructions and verdicts for each alleged period of\nabandonment constituted plain error.11\n\n        ¶43     We begin with our review of the plain language of the statute.\nBased on that review, we interpret WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. and the WIS JI—\nCHILDREN 314 (2018) model verdict questions12 to refer to a single period of\nabandonment. Particularly, both § 48.415(1)(a)3. and question 3 of the model\nverdict questions ask if a parent failed to meet or communicate with his or her\nchild “for a period of 6 months or longer”—meaning one singular period.\nSec. 48.415(1)(a)3.; WIS JI—CHILDREN 314 (2018) (emphasis added).

WIS JI—CHILDREN\n314 (2018).13\n\n        ¶44     Here, the circuit court’s failure to instruct the jury to consider a\nsingular period for each set of verdict questions and its failure to provide the jury\nwith separate verdict forms for each alleged period of abandonment resulted in the\njury failing to consider each alleged abandonment period separately and deprived\nAmanda of her right to a five-sixths verdict on each separate time period. Based\nupon the jury instructions and verdict form, we cannot determine if the same five-\nsixths of the jurors found that Amanda abandoned Lauren during one of the\nalleged periods, both of the alleged periods, or some combination of the two.\n\n        ¶45     In fact, the circuit court recognized this possibility. In finding that\nthe instructions and verdict form were sufficient, the court concluded that even if\nonly five jurors agreed on the first time period, and only five jurors agreed on the\nsecond time period, “this means 10 jurors (five-sixths) found the mother\nabandoned her child.” The court stated, “In a TPR trial, the ultimate question the\njury must answer is: did the parent abandon her child, not when did the parent\nabandon her child.” The Smiths echo this analysis, claiming the same five-sixths\nof the jury needed only to determine that Amanda “abandoned” Lauren and do not\nneed to agree as to when that occurred.\n\n\n        13\n           The jury instructions state that “[q]uestions 4-7 apply to the period of six months or\nlonger as determined in question 3.” These questions ask (4) “Did (parent) have good cause for\nhaving failed to visit with (child) during that period?,” (5) “Did (parent) have good cause for\nhaving failed to communicate with (child) during that period?,” (6) “Did (parent) communicate\nabout (child) with the (person) (persons) who had physical custody of the child during that\nperiod?,” and (7) “Did (parent) have good cause for having failed to communicate about (child)\nwith the (person) (persons) having physical custody during that period?” WIS JI—CHILDREN 314\n(2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n       ¶46     We conclude this analysis ignores the plain wording of the statute.\nAs Amanda argues, “the question of ‘when’ [she] allegedly failed to visit and\ncommunicate with Lauren is inherent to the question of ‘whether’ she abandoned\nLauren, because the definition of abandonment contains a ‘when’ question—a\nspecific ‘period of 6 months or longer.’” See WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. This\nstatutory manner of defining the grounds of “abandonment” is critical.           The\nprejudicial effect of the generalized verdict is further amplified where, as was the\ncase here, two jurors dissented from the majority’s verdict. If even one of the\nremaining ten jurors based his or her decision on a different period than the rest of\nthe jurors, the verdict did not meet the five-sixths requirement.\n\n       ¶47     We further note that following the circuit court’s rationale, a jury\ncould find abandonment by determining that Amanda failed to visit or\ncommunicate with Lauren during six individual nonconsecutive months over a\nperiod of years. This result would clearly be contrary to the statute’s wording\nrequiring the jury to determine whether the parent has failed to visit or\ncommunicate with the child “for a period of 6 months or longer.” See id. We\nconclude that this wording evidences the legislature’s clear intent that a single,\nprolonged period of abandonment is required before a parent’s fundamental rights\nare severed.\n\n       ¶48     Although the jury did not address questions five through seven of the\nverdict, had they done so using a single verdict, we would be unable to determine\nwhether five-sixths of the jury agreed that Amanda had good cause, or lacked\ngood cause, in failing to visit or communicate with Lauren during the same time\nperiod. This inability is particularly problematic where, as here, a parent argues\ndiffering good cause defenses to the alleged periods of abandonment. Thus, where\nthere are multiple alleged periods of abandonment, the jury must be instructed to\n\n                                         22\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nconsider each alleged period of abandonment separately and must be provided\nwith verdict forms as to each separate abandonment period alleged.\n\n       ¶49    In arguing to the contrary, the Smiths cite State v.

There, the defendant was charged with repeated sexual assault of the\nsame child based on the victim’s testimony that the defendant assaulted her\nmultiple times during the summer of 1997. Id., ¶4. Among other elements, the\njury was instructed that the State was required to prove that “at least three of the\nalleged sexual assaults took place from a specific period of time,” with that period\nbeing the summer of 1997. Id., ¶7. However, the applicable statute expressly\nstated that the jury must unanimously agree that at least three sexual assaults\noccurred, but it need not agree on which acts constituted the requisite number. Id.,\n¶8. The defendant was convicted and subsequently moved for a new trial, arguing\nthat his right to a unanimous verdict had been violated because “the State\nintroduced evidence of more than the minimum number of sexual assaults required\nto constitute the crime, but the jury was not instructed that it had to agree\nunanimously on the specific acts of sexual assault before convicting him.” Id., ¶9.\n\n       ¶50    Our supreme court rejected the defendant’s argument.

Applying this test, the\ncourt concluded, “Where evidence of more than three acts is admitted, the jury\nneed not unanimously agree about the underlying acts as long as it unanimously\nagrees that the defendant committed at least three.” Id., ¶15. “In other words, it is\nthe course of sexually assaultive conduct that constitutes the primary element of\n\n                                         23\n\f                                                                                    No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nthis offense, about which the jury must be unanimous…. Unanimity is explicitly\nnot required regarding the individual acts of sexual assault.” Id., ¶16\n\n        ¶51     The court further stated:\n\n                [T]he violations of the law about which the jury need not\n                be unanimous under this statutory scheme all involve the\n                sexual abuse of children, crimes of the same or similar\n                nature and level of culpability. It is therefore not unfair or\n                irrational to lift the requirement of jury unanimity as to the\n                specific underlying acts as long as unanimity is required\n                regarding the existence of the course of conduct.\n\nId., ¶19.\n\n        ¶52     Applying the same logic from the William. Johnson court, the\ncircuit court found—and the Smiths argue on appeal—that “[t]he five-sixths\nthreshold is met upon the jury returning a finding of abandonment—that is all the\nlaw requires the jury to decide.            The law does not require deciding alleged\nmultiple periods of abandonment separately, nor does it require multiple periods to\nbe presented to the jury separately.”\n\n        ¶53     We consider this analogy inapt.14                Here, unlike WIS. STAT.\n§ 948.025(2), the course of conduct necessary to support a judgment on a claim for\nabandonment—i.e., one of the essential elements—is a period of abandonment of\nsix or more months.          The legislature has recognized the fundamental rights\n\n\n        14\n          The circuit court also considered whether separate jury instructions and verdict forms\nwere needed by comparing this issue to the context of party-to-a-crime liability, in that there are\n“various ways a person might be guilty as a party to a crime without requiring the jurors to agree\non the applicable theory or theories.” See Holland v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1900310\"><a href=\"/opinion/1900310/holland-v-state/#143\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Holland v.

State\">280 N.W.2d\n288</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979). We do not find this reasoning persuasive, as there is no allegation here that the time\nelement of abandonment can be proven in a variety of ways; it can only be proven if a child is\nabandoned for a period of six months or more.\n\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\naffected by TPR proceedings, and, in order to terminate those rights, it requires\nproof that a parent abandoned his or her child under WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3.\nfor a period of at least six months. Further, the legislature has provided a parent\nwith the opportunity to present a defense of good cause, the facts of which are\nspecifically related to each period of abandonment alleged. In other words, based\nupon our interpretation of WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3, we conclude that in order to\npermanently destroy all legal recognition of the parental relationship, five-sixths\nof the jury must agree on one period of abandonment, and the same five-sixths of\nthe jury must agree that the parent did not have good cause for failing to visit or\ncommunicate with the child or his or her custodian during that abandonment\nperiod.\n\n       ¶54    The Smiths also contrast abandonment under WIS. STAT.\n§ 48.415(1)(a)3. with the finding of dangerousness required to have a person\ninvoluntarily committed under WIS. STAT. § 51.20. The Smiths note that circuit\ncourts must make specific factual findings regarding a subject’s dangerousness in\norder to clearly track the necessary elements for involuntary commitment. See\nLanglade County v. D.J.W., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4528537\"><a href=\"/opinion/4748190/langlade-county-v-d-j-w/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Langlade County v. D. J.

The Smiths assert that there is no\nsubcategorization of types of abandonment in § 48.415(1)(a)3. as there is for the\ntypes of dangerousness in § 51.20; instead, § 48.415(1)(a)3. has “a singular\nevidentiary threshold.” From these differences, they contend that the jury need not\ndifferentiate between periods of abandonment in reaching its decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\n         ¶55   We are not persuaded.          Abandonment under WIS. STAT.\n§ 48.415(1)(a)3. does not have a singular evidentiary threshold as the Smiths\nsuggest. Rather, there is a secondary evidentiary threshold concerning the parent’s\nright to present a good cause defense to abandonment under § 48.415(1)(c), and\nthat statute provides multiple ways in which a parent can prove a good cause\ndefense. This defense not only directly corresponds to the specific alleged period\nof abandonment, but it also has a different evidentiary burden. See WIS. STAT.\n§ 48.31(1) (stating that the grounds under § 48.415 must be proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence); § 48.415(1)(c) (stating that a parent must prove his or her\ndefense to abandonment by a preponderance of the evidence).\n\n         ¶56   Regardless, as stated above, in order to find abandonment when\nmultiple time periods are alleged, we interpret WIS. STAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3 as\nrequiring that five-sixths of the jury agree both on a period of abandonment and\nthat the parent did not have good cause for failing to visit or communicate with the\nchild or his or her custodian during that specific abandonment period in order for\nthere to be grounds for TPR. The circuit court’s failure to provide the jury with\ninstructions and verdict forms that complied with these statutory requirements,\nthereby depriving Amanda of her right to a five-sixths verdict, constituted plain\nerror.\n\nIV. Harmless Error.\n\n         ¶57   Having concluded that the failure to provide the jury with separate\ninstructions and special verdict forms for each alleged period of abandonment was\na fundamental, obvious, and substantial error, the burden now shifts to the Smiths\nto show that the error was harmless.

They “contend\nthat any such error is appropriately deemed harmless.” They further assert that\n“[t]he record does not support, and Amanda fails to present, any evidence\ndemonstrating the jury’s verdict was unreliable, or that any juror could have\nreached a different conclusion had the alleged error not occurred.”\n\n       ¶59    In making this argument, the Smiths ignore that they have the\nburden to prove harmless error. In addition, they fail to address the clear violation\nof Amanda’s right to a five-sixths jury verdict. As discussed above, the circuit\ncourt’s failure to properly instruct the jury and provide separate verdicts for each\nalleged abandonment period prevents us from determining if the same five-sixths\nof the jurors found that Amanda abandoned Lauren during one six-month time\nperiod. There is a reasonable possibility that these errors contributed to the jury’s\nfinding of abandonment. Further, it is possible that the jury may have found\nAmanda had good cause for failing to communicate with or visit Lauren if the jury\nhad been asked to consider each period of abandonment separately. We therefore\nconclude that the circuit court’s failure to properly instruct the jury and provide\nseparate verdicts for each alleged period of abandonment was not harmless.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶60    A parent’s failure to visit or communicate with his or her child for a\nperiod of six months or longer is an essential element of abandonment under WIS.\nSTAT. § 48.415(1)(a)3. When multiple periods of abandonment are alleged, that\n\n                                         27\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP2532\n\n\n\n\nstatute requires the jury must be instructed to consider each period of\nabandonment separately, and the jury must be provided with a separate verdict\nform for each period of abandonment. As this area of the law was previously\nunsettled, Amanda’s counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to question the\njury instructions and verdict form. We now conclude, however, that the circuit\ncourt’s failure to properly instruct the jury and provide separate verdict forms for\neach abandonment period alleged deprived Amanda of her right to a five-sixths\nverdict, constituting plain error. We further conclude that such error was not\nharmless. We therefore reverse the court’s order terminating Amanda’s parental\nrights to Lauren and the order denying Amanda’s postdisposition motion, and we\nremand with directions for a new factfinding hearing consistent with this decision.\n\n              By the Court.—Orders reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n              Recommended for publication in the official reports.\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f\f</pre>",

S.// Cross-Appellant, A. S.\n\n                                                v.\n\n                            Appellee, A. S.// Cross-Appellee, C. S. S.\n\n\n              FROM THE 419TH DISTRICT COURT OF TRAVIS COUNTY\n NO. D-1-FM-19-004143, THE HONORABLE MARIA CANTÚ HEXSEL, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               The parties bring cross-appeals from the trial court’s final decree of divorce\n\nfollowing a bench trial.    In four issues, C.S.S. (Husband) challenges the legal and factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s division of the community estate,\n\nparticularly the trial court’s determinations of real property values and A.S.’s (Wife) separate\n\nproperty interests in two houses, and its failure to award post-judgment interest. In her cross\n\nappeal, Wife requests attorney’s fees. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court’s final\n\ndecree of divorce.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               The parties were informally married in September 2003, they ceased living\n\ntogether in 2017 or 2018, and Husband filed for divorce in June 2019. 1\n\n               The bench trial occurred in October 2022. The parties’ disputes concerned the\n\ndivision of the community estate. During their marriage, the parties generally kept their finances\n\nseparate, but relevant to this appeal, they formed La Tierra de Simmons Familia, Ltd., and Magic\n\nCouple, Inc., the 1% general partner of La Tierra. At the time of the parties’ divorce, La Tierra\n\nowned commercial properties. In the final decree, the trial court awarded La Tierra and Magic\n\nCouple to Wife and, based in part on the trial court’s determinations of the values of La Tierra’s\n\ncommercial properties, equalized the division of the community estate by awarding Husband\n\n$7,613,744.84.     The trial court ordered Wife to pay this amount in three equal lump-sum\n\npayments of $2,537,914.95, due 180, 360, and 540 days after the final decree was signed\n\nand entered.\n\n                 Both parties testified and presented expert witness testimony as to real property\n\nvalues in the community estate, including opinions as to the values of La Tierra’s commercial\n\nproperties. Wife’s expert prepared reports in April 2021 of his opinions on real property values,\n\nwhich reports were admitted as exhibits, but testified that he would need to do “more due\n\ndiligence” to provide opinions as to market values at the time of trial. He believed that market\n\nconditions had changed and that some of the property values had “[l]ikely” increased but also\n\ntestified that a few of the properties had not increased in value. Husband’s expert provided\n\n“back of the napkin” opinions of current market values.            In response to a motion for\n\n\n       1  The parties’ child was no longer a minor when the bench trial occurred and is not\naddressed in the final decree of divorce.\n                                                 2\n\freconsideration and without objection from Husband, Wife also provided the trial court with a\n\nspreadsheet that included tax appraisal values of La Tierra’s commercial properties, which the\n\ntrial court admitted as an exhibit in the case.        The trial court granted the motion for\n\nreconsideration in part and increased its determinations of the values of La Tierra’s commercial\n\nproperties for purposes of its division of the community estate.\n\n                The parties’ disputes also concerned separate property issues, particularly Wife’s\n\nseparate property interests in two houses, the “Glenview” house and the “Cape Cod” house. The\n\nparties purchased the Glenview house in 2014. Wife’s separate property during the marriage\n\nincluded another house—the “Rocky River” house—that she was under contract to sell and that\n\nwas scheduled to close on the same day as the closing to purchase the Glenview house. Wife\n\nintended to use $200,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Rocky River house as a\n\ndownpayment toward the purchase price of $955,000 on the Glenview house. After the closing\n\non the Rocky River house was delayed, Wife obtained a short-term “bridge” loan of $200,000\n\nagainst her separate property interest in shares of Amy’s Ice Creams and used the borrowed\n\nfunds at closing as the downpayment on the Glenview house. After the closing on the Rocky\n\nRiver house approximately a month later, Wife paid the $200,000 loan off from the proceeds of\n\nthat house’s sale. The evidence was undisputed that Wife was the majority shareholder of\n\nAmy’s Ice Creams and that her shares, which she had owned prior to the parties’ marriage, were\n\nher separate property. In the final decree, the trial court awarded the Glenview house to Wife\n\nand, for purposes of its division of the community estate, found that Wife had a 20.94% separate\n\nproperty interest in the house. 2\n\n\n        2200,000 is 20.94% of 955,000. The trial court’s value of the Glenview house was\n$1,610,000, and the debt on the house was $401,429.63. Based on these amounts and for\n                                                 3\n\f                As to the Cape Cod house, Wife purchased the house in 2019, paying for the\n\nhouse in part with inherited funds. The Wife presented evidence that she paid $154,700 from\n\nfunds that she had inherited toward the purchase of the Cape Cod house. The purchase price was\n\n$1,325,000. In the final decree, the trial court awarded the Cape Cod house to Wife and, for\n\npurposes of its division of the community estate, found that Wife had a 11.68% separate property\n\ninterest in the house. 3\n\n                Husband filed a motion for new trial, motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, and motion to modify the judgment. Among his complaints, Husband contended that the\n\ntrial court should have awarded him post-judgment interest on the equalization payments. The\n\nmotions were overruled by operation of law. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\nStandard of Review\n\n                Husband’s issues primarily challenge the trial court’s division of the community\n\nestate and the trial court’s characterization of property. We review these types of challenges for\n\nan abuse of discretion. Eichhorn v. Eichhorn, No. 03-20-00382-CV, 2022 Tex. App. LEXIS 3453,\n\nat *4 (Tex. App.—Austin May 20, 2022, no pet.)

Based on these\namounts and for purposes of its division of the community estate, the trial court found that the\nvalue of Wife’s separate property interest was $192,646.35 (approximately 11.68% of\n$1,650,000) and that the value of the community property interest was $467,957.09.\n                                                4\n\fno pet.)

Murff, 615 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Tex. 1981) (stating that trial court has discretion to balance\n\nrelevant factors and determine proper division). “The test of whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion is whether the court acted arbitrarily or unreasonably, and without reference to any\n\nguiding principles.” Morris, 2021 Tex.

App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.)). “In these cases,\n\nlegal and factual insufficiency are not independent grounds of error but are relevant factors in\n\nassessing whether the trial court abused its discretion.”         Id. (citing Coburn v. Moreland,\n\n433 S.W.3d 809, 823 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, no pet.); Zeifman v. Michels, 212 S.W.3d 582,\n\n587 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied)). “Thus, in determining whether the trial court\n\nabused its discretion, we consider whether the court had sufficient evidence upon which to\n\nexercise its discretion, and if so, whether it erred in the application of that discretion.” Id. at *3–\n\n4 (citing Coburn, 433 S.W.3d at 823; Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 588). “When the record contains\n\nsome evidence of a substantive and probative character supporting the trial court’s decision,\n\nthere is no abuse of discretion.” Id. at *5 (citing Tran v.

Fam. Code § 7.001. “We presume on appeal\n\nthat the trial court correctly exercised its discretion when dividing property in a divorce\n\nproceeding, and the appellant bears the burden to show from the record that the division was so\n\ndisproportionate, and thus unfair, that it constitutes an abuse of discretion.”         O’Carolan\n\nv.

App.—Texarkana 1996, writ denied)).\n\n               In general, “market value” is the method to value community property that is to\n\nbe divided in a divorce proceeding. R.V.K. v. L.L.K., 103 S.W.3d 612, 618 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2003, no pet.); accord Mandell v. Mandell, 310 S.W.3d 531, 536 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2010, pet. denied). “Fair market value has been consistently defined as the amount that a\n\nwilling buyer, who desires to buy, but is under no obligation to buy would pay to a willing seller,\n\nwho desires to sell, but is under no obligation to sell.” R.V.K., 103 S.W.3d at 618 (quoting\n\nWendlandt v. Wendlandt, 596 S.W.2d 323, 325 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, no writ)).\n\n               For purposes of determining the division of the community estate, the trial court\n\ngenerally values community assets as of the date of divorce. O’Carolan, 414 S.W.3d at 311. “In\n\n                                                 6\n\fvaluing the assets in the estate, if several values are given, or if a witness testifies that the value\n\nmay be higher or lower than his estimate, the court’s determination of the value should be within\n\nthe ranges in the evidence.” Banker v. Banker, 517 S.W.3d 863, 870 (Tex. App.—Corpus\n\nChristi–Edinburg 2017, pet. denied) (citing Van Heerden v. Van Heerden, 321 S.W.3d 869, 880\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.); Mata v. Mata, 710 S.W.2d 756, 758 (Tex.\n\nApp—Corpus Christi–Edinburg 1986, no writ)). “Where the uncontested evidence establishes\n\nonly one value, the trial court cannot draw a different inference.” Id. (citing Mata, 710 S.W.2d\n\nat 758).\n\n               Husband’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence appears to be directed to\n\nthe trial court’s determinations of the values of La Tierra’s commercial properties for purposes of\n\nits division of the community estate. Husband contends that “the foundational data” used by\n\nWife’s expert to form his opinions as to real property values, particularly the values of\n\nLa Tierra’s commercial properties, was “unreliable and constituted no more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence” because the expert’s valuation reports were based on data from April 2021, and the\n\nexpert testified that he would need more information to provide opinions as to market values on\n\nthe date of the divorce in October 2022.\n\n               In response to Husband’s motion for reconsideration before the trial court and on\n\nappeal, Wife acknowledges that the tax appraisal values were more current than her expert’s\n\nopinions on values. She represents that she “was willing to stipulate to the [trial court’s] use of\n\nthose numbers to determine the appropriate calculation for the payment to equalize the division\n\nof the community estate,” that the trial court admitted the spreadsheet of tax appraisal values\n\nwithout objection by Husband, and that “it appears that based on [Husband’s] argument in this\n\nappeal and [her] agreement, those are the numbers that should be used to calculate the correct\n\n                                                  7\n\fpayment to equalize the division of the community estate.” Wife further argues that the “only\n\nuncontested evidence regarding value were the tax appraisal values” and, therefore, “[t]hose are\n\nthe values that the court should have used in its calculation.”\n\n                In his reply brief, Husband contends that the trial court could not rely on the tax\n\nappraisal values to make the property division between the parties because tax appraisal values\n\n“do not reflect the true value of real property,” and Wife testified at trial that tax appraisal values\n\nwere “clearly not market values.” 4 Wife also states on appeal that “[t]he evidence at trial\n\nregarding property values was mixed” and that the trial court’s valuations were within the range\n\nof evidence. 5 In making its determinations in the final decree, in addition to the tax appraisal\n\nvalues and the evidence from Wife’s expert, the trial court could have relied on the opinions of\n\nthe parties and Husband’s expert as to real property values. See Jatex Oil & Gas Expl. L.P.\n\nv. Nadel & Gussman Permian, L.L.C., 629 S.W.3d 397, 406 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2020, no pet.)\n\n(“Under the Property Owner Rule, a property owner is generally qualified to testify to the value\n\n       4   To the extent Husband raises new arguments that he did not raise before the trial court\nor in his appellant’s brief about the tax appraisal data, he has waived those arguments. See Tex.\nR. App. P. 33.1(a); McFadden v. Olesky, 517 S.W.3d 287, 293 n.3 (Tex. App.—Austin 2017,\npet. denied) (“Ordinarily, an argument asserted for the first time in a reply brief is waived and\nneed not be considered by an appellate court.”). For example, he contends that the trial court\ncould not consider the tax appraisal values because they were not properly proven up or\npresented to the trial court through a sponsoring witness, but he did not object to the admission\nof the spreadsheet showing the values when it was offered by Wife, and the spreadsheet was\nadmitted before the trial court signed the final decree of divorce.\n       5   In her brief, Wife agreed with Husband’s statement:\n\n\n       In valuing the assets in the community estate, if several values are given, or if a\n       witness testifies that the value may be higher or lower than his estimate, the\n       court’s determination of the value should be within the ranges in the evidence.\n\n\nShe then represents that using her expert’s values or the tax appraisal values would keep the trial\ncourt within the ranges of the evidence on values.\n                                                  8\n\fof his property even if he is not an expert and would not be qualified to testify to the value of\n\nother property.” (citing Reid Rd.

(explaining\n\nthat when tax appraisal is admitted without objection, “it can constitute some probative evidence\n\non which the fact finder could rely to determine the fair market value of real property”). Thus,\n\nwe conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to consider in making its\n\ndeterminations of values. See Goyal, 2021 Tex. App. LEXIS 4205, at *5.\n\n               Based on our review of the evidence of the varying opinions, we also observe that\n\nthe trial court’s determinations of real property values were within the ranges of this evidence. 6\n\nSee Banker, 517 S.W.3d at 870.         In this context, we cannot conclude that based on its\n\ndeterminations of real property values, the trial court abused its discretion in its division of the\n\ncommunity estate. See O’Carolan, 414 S.W.3d at 311 (explaining that on appeal, appellate court\n\npresumes trial court correctly exercised its discretion when dividing property in divorce\n\nproceeding and appellant bears burden to show from record that division was so\n\ndisproportionate, and thus unfair, that it constitutes abuse of discretion). We overrule Husband’s\n\nfirst issue.\n\n\n\n\n        6 For example, for purposes of its property division, the trial court assigned the value of\n$258,497.40 to one of La Tierra’s commercial properties. This value was within the range of the\nvaluation evidence from: (i) Husband (between $250,000 and $300,000), his expert ($240,000),\nWife ($262,500), her expert ($246,188), and (ii) the tax appraisal value ($132,228).\n                                                 9\n\fChallenges to Wife’s Separate Property Interests\n\n               In his second and third issues, Husband contends that the trial court erred and/or\n\nabused its discretion when it awarded separate property interests to Wife in the Glenview house\n\nand the Cape Cod house.\n\n\n       Characterization of Property as Community or Separate Property\n\n               “Property owned or claimed by the spouse before marriage” or “[p]roperty\n\nacquired by the spouse during marriage by gift, devise or descent” is separate property.

App.—Dallas 2005, pet.\n\ndenied)); see Bean, 658 S.W.3d at 416 (describing “burden of tracing” to establish separate\n\nproperty). “Tracing involves establishing the separate origin of the property through evidence\n\nshowing the time and means by which the spouse originally obtained possession of the\n\nproperty.” Ganesan, 96 S.W.3d at 354.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f       Glenview House\n\n               In his second issue, Husband contends that the evidence was legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the trial court’s award to Wife of a 20.94% separate property interest in\n\nthe Glenview house. Husband contends that Wife failed to introduce evidence to rebut the\n\npresumption that the Glenview house, which was acquired during the parties’ marriage, was\n\ncommunity property. See Tex. Fam. Code § 3.002. He focuses on the testimony of Wife’s\n\nexpert that the $200,000 down payment on the home “was just a reimbursement claim for the\n\ncontribution of $200,000” and “not a separate property claim.” See id. §§ 3.001 (defining\n\nseparate property), .003 (stating that property possessed by either spouse during or on dissolution\n\nof marriage is presumed community property).\n\n               The evidence at trial, however, was uncontroverted that the purchase price for the\n\nGlenview house was $955,000 and that Wife paid $200,000 at the closing with funds that she\n\nhad borrowed against her separate-property majority shares in Amy’s Ice Creams. See Holloway\n\nv. Holloway, 671 S.W.2d 51, 57 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1983, writ dism’d) (explaining that\n\ncharacter of debt is separate when express agreement on part of lender “to look solely to the\n\nseparate estate of the purchasing spouse for satisfaction of the indebtedness”). Wife testified that\n\nshe obtained the short-term bridge loan against her shares because the sale of the Rocky River\n\nhouse, which she acquired before the parties’ marriage and was her separate property, was\n\ndelayed. When that property sold, she repaid the $200,000 loan to Amy’s Ice Creams from the\n\nproceeds of that sale.      This uncontroverted testimony traced Wife’s separate property\n\ntransactions to the $200,000 payment toward the purchase of the Glenview house. See Bean,\n\n658 S.W.3d at 417. Because there was uncontroverted evidence tracing the $200,000 payment to\n\nWife’s separate estate, we conclude that there was some evidence of a substantive and probative\n\n                                                12\n\fcharacter supporting the trial court’s decision that when Wife and Husband obtained title to the\n\nGlenview house, Wife had a separate property interest in it. See Rivera, 441 S.W.3d at 419–20;\n\nsee also Tex. Fam. Code § 3.006; Goyal, 2021 Tex. App. LEXIS 4205, at *5. Thus, we cannot\n\nconclude that the trial court abused its discretion when for purposes of its division of the\n\ncommunity estate, the trial court found that Wife had a 20.94% separate property interest in the\n\nhouse. We overrule Husband’s second issue.\n\n\n       Cape Cod House\n\n               In his third issue, Husband contends that the evidence was legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the trial court’s award to Wife of an 11.68% separate property interest in\n\nthe Cape Cod house. He argues that according to the inception of title doctrine, the Cape Cod\n\nhouse was community property because it was acquired during marriage and that there was no\n\nevidence to demonstrate that Wife had “any separate property interest” in the house.\n\n               The evidence was that the purchase price of the Cape Cod house was $1,325,000,\n\nand Wife testified that she used inherited funds of $154,700 toward the purchase of the house.\n\nHusband argues that “at best” Wife’s separate property interest did not exceed 4.65%, relying on\n\nWife’s expert’s report and testimony that traceable inherited funds supported a 3.49% or 4.65%\n\nseparate property interest.   But the expert’s testimony was based on information as to a\n\nretirement account that Wife inherited from her mother, the expert testified that she had been\n\nunable to review account information as to retirement accounts that Wife had inherited from her\n\nfather and uncle, and account statements from the other inherited accounts were admitted as\n\nexhibits. Wife also testified that she had inherited retirement accounts from her mother, father,\n\nand uncle, and that the $154,700 that she paid toward the house purchase was from these\n\n\n                                               13\n\finherited accounts. Husband did not present conflicting evidence. For purposes of the trial\n\ncourt’s division of the community estate, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support\n\nthe trial court’s determination of Wife’s separate property interest in the Cape Cod house. See\n\nTex. Fam. Code §§ 3.001, .006; Bean, 658 S.W.3d at 416–17; see also Goyal, 2021 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 4205, at *5. We overrule Husband’s third issue.\n\n\nPost-Judgment Interest\n\n              In his fourth issue, Husband argues that the trial court erred by failing to award\n\nhim post-judgment interest as required by the Texas Finance Code. He contends that he is\n\nentitled to post-judgment interest on the cash payments awarded to him in the final decree. The\n\ntrial court ordered Wife to pay three lump-sum payments of $2,537,914,95, with the following\n\ndue dates: the first payment, 180 days after the final decree was signed and entered; the second\n\npayment, 360 days; and the third payment, 540 days.\n\n              As support for his position that the trial court should have awarded post-judgment\n\ninterest, Husband relies on Section 304.001 of the Texas Finance Code. See Tex. Fin. Code\n\n§ 304.001. Section 304.001 provides, “A money judgment of a court in this state must specify\n\nthe postjudgment interest rate applicable to that judgment.” Id. But a cash award to equalize the\n\ntrial court’s division of the community estate is distinct from a money judgment. See de la\n\nGarza v. de la Garza, 185 S.W.3d 924, 930 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.); see also Tex. Fin.\n\nCode § 301.002(a)(12) (defining “money judgment” as “a judgment for money”); cf. Office of\n\nthe Attorney Gen. of Tex. v. Lee, 92 S.W.3d 526, 528 (Tex. 2002) (per curiam) (concluding that\n\npost-judgment interest accrued on judgment for past-due child support). Rejecting a similar\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fargument to Husband’s that post-judgment interest accrues on a cash award that is part of a trial\n\ncourt’s division of a marital estate, our sister court explained,\n\n\n       A party who does not receive payments of money awarded in a divorce decree\n       may file suit to enforce the decree and the trial court may render a money\n       judgment for the amount of unpaid payments. . . . A money judgment is a remedy\n       available to a spouse where the other spouse does not make payments as ordered\n       in the divorce decree.\n\n\nde da Garza, 185 S.W.3d at 930 (citing Tex. Fam. Code §§ 9.001(a), .010(b); Office of the\n\nAttorney Gen. of Tex. v. Wilson, 24 S.W.3d 902, 905 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000, no pet.); Jenkins\n\nv. Jenkins, 991 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1999, pet. denied)). Our sister court\n\nconcluded that the cash awards in the final decree were not a money judgment for purposes of\n\naccruing post-judgment interest and distinguished the cash awards with the judgment for\n\npast-due child support that was at issue in Lee. See de la Garza, 185 S.W.3d at 930 (factually\n\ndistinguishing Lee because “appellant had never had the past-due payments on the monetary\n\naward reduced to judgment” unlike in Lee where judgment obtained for past-due child support\n\nsupported accruing post-judgment interest). Guided by our sister court’s analysis in de la Garza,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Husband’s request to order post-judgment\n\ninterest on the three lump-sum cash payments. See id.\n\n               Husband also argues that the trial court should have ordered post-judgment\n\ninterest based on the trial court’s temporary order suspending the lump-sum payments on appeal.\n\nIn its temporary order, the trial court required Wife to pay the lump-sum amounts into the court\n\nregistry or post three supersedeas bonds as of the due dates set out in the divorce decree. See\n\nTex. Fam. Code § 6.709(a) (authorizing trial court to “render temporary order as considered\n\nequitable and necessary for the preservation of the property and the protection of the parties\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fduring an appeal”). In this procedural context, Husband has not cited, and we have not found,\n\nauthority that would require the trial court to order post-judgment interest during the pendency of\n\nthe appeal.\n\n               For these reasons, we overrule Husband’s fourth issue.\n\n\nCross-Appeal\n\n               In her cross-appeal, Wife requests attorney’s fees if she is successful in defending\n\nHusband’s appeal or if this Court equalizes the division of the community estate using the tax\n\nappraisal values “in lieu of the values actually used by the trial court.” Wife does not cite, and\n\nwe have not found, authority that would support awarding attorney’s fees to her on appeal. The\n\nfinal judgment expressly states, “To effect an equitable division of the estate of the parties and as\n\npart of the division, each party shall be responsible for his or her own attorney’s fees, expenses,\n\nand costs incurred as a result of legal representation in this case.” Wife has not challenged this\n\ntrial-court ruling. We deny Wife’s request for attorney’s fees on cross-appeal.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               For these reasons, we affirm the trial court’s final decree.\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n                                              Rosa Lopez Theofanis, Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Byrne, Justices Smith and Theofanis\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: September 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f",

S.\n\n\n              FROM THE 419TH DISTRICT COURT OF TRAVIS COUNTY\n NO. D-1-FM-19-004143, THE HONORABLE MARIA CANTÚ HEXSEL, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               The parties bring cross-appeals from the trial court’s final decree of divorce\n\nfollowing a bench trial.    In four issues, C.S.S. (Husband) challenges the legal and factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s division of the community estate,\n\nparticularly the trial court’s determinations of real property values and A.S.’s (Wife) separate\n\nproperty interests in two houses, and its failure to award post-judgment interest. In her cross\n\nappeal, Wife requests attorney’s fees. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court’s final\n\ndecree of divorce.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               The parties were informally married in September 2003, they ceased living\n\ntogether in 2017 or 2018, and Husband filed for divorce in June 2019. 1\n\n               The bench trial occurred in October 2022. The parties’ disputes concerned the\n\ndivision of the community estate. During their marriage, the parties generally kept their finances\n\nseparate, but relevant to this appeal, they formed La Tierra de Simmons Familia, Ltd., and Magic\n\nCouple, Inc., the 1% general partner of La Tierra. At the time of the parties’ divorce, La Tierra\n\nowned commercial properties. In the final decree, the trial court awarded La Tierra and Magic\n\nCouple to Wife and, based in part on the trial court’s determinations of the values of La Tierra’s\n\ncommercial properties, equalized the division of the community estate by awarding Husband\n\n$7,613,744.84.     The trial court ordered Wife to pay this amount in three equal lump-sum\n\npayments of $2,537,914.95, due 180, 360, and 540 days after the final decree was signed\n\nand entered.\n\n                 Both parties testified and presented expert witness testimony as to real property\n\nvalues in the community estate, including opinions as to the values of La Tierra’s commercial\n\nproperties. Wife’s expert prepared reports in April 2021 of his opinions on real property values,\n\nwhich reports were admitted as exhibits, but testified that he would need to do “more due\n\ndiligence” to provide opinions as to market values at the time of trial. He believed that market\n\nconditions had changed and that some of the property values had “[l]ikely” increased but also\n\ntestified that a few of the properties had not increased in value. Husband’s expert provided\n\n“back of the napkin” opinions of current market values.            In response to a motion for\n\n\n       1  The parties’ child was no longer a minor when the bench trial occurred and is not\naddressed in the final decree of divorce.\n                                                 2\n\freconsideration and without objection from Husband, Wife also provided the trial court with a\n\nspreadsheet that included tax appraisal values of La Tierra’s commercial properties, which the\n\ntrial court admitted as an exhibit in the case.        The trial court granted the motion for\n\nreconsideration in part and increased its determinations of the values of La Tierra’s commercial\n\nproperties for purposes of its division of the community estate.\n\n                The parties’ disputes also concerned separate property issues, particularly Wife’s\n\nseparate property interests in two houses, the “Glenview” house and the “Cape Cod” house. The\n\nparties purchased the Glenview house in 2014. Wife’s separate property during the marriage\n\nincluded another house—the “Rocky River” house—that she was under contract to sell and that\n\nwas scheduled to close on the same day as the closing to purchase the Glenview house. Wife\n\nintended to use $200,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Rocky River house as a\n\ndownpayment toward the purchase price of $955,000 on the Glenview house. After the closing\n\non the Rocky River house was delayed, Wife obtained a short-term “bridge” loan of $200,000\n\nagainst her separate property interest in shares of Amy’s Ice Creams and used the borrowed\n\nfunds at closing as the downpayment on the Glenview house. After the closing on the Rocky\n\nRiver house approximately a month later, Wife paid the $200,000 loan off from the proceeds of\n\nthat house’s sale. The evidence was undisputed that Wife was the majority shareholder of\n\nAmy’s Ice Creams and that her shares, which she had owned prior to the parties’ marriage, were\n\nher separate property. In the final decree, the trial court awarded the Glenview house to Wife\n\nand, for purposes of its division of the community estate, found that Wife had a 20.94% separate\n\nproperty interest in the house. 2\n\n\n        2200,000 is 20.94% of 955,000. The trial court’s value of the Glenview house was\n$1,610,000, and the debt on the house was $401,429.63. Based on these amounts and for\n                                                 3\n\f                As to the Cape Cod house, Wife purchased the house in 2019, paying for the\n\nhouse in part with inherited funds. The Wife presented evidence that she paid $154,700 from\n\nfunds that she had inherited toward the purchase of the Cape Cod house. The purchase price was\n\n$1,325,000. In the final decree, the trial court awarded the Cape Cod house to Wife and, for\n\npurposes of its division of the community estate, found that Wife had a 11.68% separate property\n\ninterest in the house. 3\n\n                Husband filed a motion for new trial, motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, and motion to modify the judgment. Among his complaints, Husband contended that the\n\ntrial court should have awarded him post-judgment interest on the equalization payments. The\n\nmotions were overruled by operation of law. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\nStandard of Review\n\n                Husband’s issues primarily challenge the trial court’s division of the community\n\nestate and the trial court’s characterization of property. We review these types of challenges for\n\nan abuse of discretion. Eichhorn v. Eichhorn, No. 03-20-00382-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 Tex.

Husband contends that “the foundational data” used by\n\nWife’s expert to form his opinions as to real property values, particularly the values of\n\nLa Tierra’s commercial properties, was “unreliable and constituted no more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence” because the expert’s valuation reports were based on data from April 2021, and the\n\nexpert testified that he would need more information to provide opinions as to market values on\n\nthe date of the divorce in October 2022.\n\n               In response to Husband’s motion for reconsideration before the trial court and on\n\nappeal, Wife acknowledges that the tax appraisal values were more current than her expert’s\n\nopinions on values. She represents that she “was willing to stipulate to the [trial court’s] use of\n\nthose numbers to determine the appropriate calculation for the payment to equalize the division\n\nof the community estate,” that the trial court admitted the spreadsheet of tax appraisal values\n\nwithout objection by Husband, and that “it appears that based on [Husband’s] argument in this\n\nappeal and [her] agreement, those are the numbers that should be used to calculate the correct\n\n                                                  7\n\fpayment to equalize the division of the community estate.” Wife further argues that the “only\n\nuncontested evidence regarding value were the tax appraisal values” and, therefore, “[t]hose are\n\nthe values that the court should have used in its calculation.”\n\n                In his reply brief, Husband contends that the trial court could not rely on the tax\n\nappraisal values to make the property division between the parties because tax appraisal values\n\n“do not reflect the true value of real property,” and Wife testified at trial that tax appraisal values\n\nwere “clearly not market values.” 4 Wife also states on appeal that “[t]he evidence at trial\n\nregarding property values was mixed” and that the trial court’s valuations were within the range\n\nof evidence. 5 In making its determinations in the final decree, in addition to the tax appraisal\n\nvalues and the evidence from Wife’s expert, the trial court could have relied on the opinions of\n\nthe parties and Husband’s expert as to real property values.

But the expert’s testimony was based on information as to a\n\nretirement account that Wife inherited from her mother, the expert testified that she had been\n\nunable to review account information as to retirement accounts that Wife had inherited from her\n\nfather and uncle, and account statements from the other inherited accounts were admitted as\n\nexhibits. Wife also testified that she had inherited retirement accounts from her mother, father,\n\nand uncle, and that the $154,700 that she paid toward the house purchase was from these\n\n\n                                               13\n\finherited accounts. Husband did not present conflicting evidence. For purposes of the trial\n\ncourt’s division of the community estate, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support\n\nthe trial court’s determination of Wife’s separate property interest in the Cape Cod house. See\n\nTex. Fam. Code §§ 3.001, .006; Bean, 658 S.W.3d at 416–17; see also Goyal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 4205</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. We overrule Husband’s third issue.\n\n\nPost-Judgment Interest\n\n              In his fourth issue, Husband argues that the trial court erred by failing to award\n\nhim post-judgment interest as required by the Texas Finance Code. He contends that he is\n\nentitled to post-judgment interest on the cash payments awarded to him in the final decree. The\n\ntrial court ordered Wife to pay three lump-sum payments of $2,537,914,95, with the following\n\ndue dates: the first payment, 180 days after the final decree was signed and entered; the second\n\npayment, 360 days; and the third payment, 540 days.\n\n              As support for his position that the trial court should have awarded post-judgment\n\ninterest, Husband relies on Section 304.001 of the Texas Finance Code. See Tex. Fin. Code\n\n§ 304.001. Section 304.001 provides, “A money judgment of a court in this state must specify\n\nthe postjudgment interest rate applicable to that judgment.” Id. But a cash award to equalize the\n\ntrial court’s division of the community estate is distinct from a money judgment.

See\n\nTex. Fam. Code § 6.709(a) (authorizing trial court to “render temporary order as considered\n\nequitable and necessary for the preservation of the property and the protection of the parties\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fduring an appeal”). In this procedural context, Husband has not cited, and we have not found,\n\nauthority that would require the trial court to order post-judgment interest during the pendency of\n\nthe appeal.\n\n               For these reasons, we overrule Husband’s fourth issue.\n\n\nCross-Appeal\n\n               In her cross-appeal, Wife requests attorney’s fees if she is successful in defending\n\nHusband’s appeal or if this Court equalizes the division of the community estate using the tax\n\nappraisal values “in lieu of the values actually used by the trial court.” Wife does not cite, and\n\nwe have not found, authority that would support awarding attorney’s fees to her on appeal. The\n\nfinal judgment expressly states, “To effect an equitable division of the estate of the parties and as\n\npart of the division, each party shall be responsible for his or her own attorney’s fees, expenses,\n\nand costs incurred as a result of legal representation in this case.” Wife has not challenged this\n\ntrial-court ruling. We deny Wife’s request for attorney’s fees on cross-appeal.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               For these reasons, we affirm the trial court’s final decree.\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n                                              Rosa Lopez Theofanis, Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Byrne, Justices Smith and Theofanis\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: September 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f</pre>",

(\"the father\") appeals from a judgment entered by the Lee\n\nCircuit Court (\"the trial court\") in an action in which he sought to modify\n\nthe judgment that had divorced him from S.G.S. (\"the mother\"). We\n\naffirm in part and reverse in part.\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n                              Background\n\n      The father and the mother divorced on November 28, 2016. The\n\ndivorce judgment incorporated a settlement agreement between the\n\nparties. Four children, all daughters, were born of the marriage: A.B.S.\n\n(born in 2007), M.C.S. (born in 2009), L.E.S. (born in 2010), and S.K.S.\n\n(born in 2011). Pursuant to the terms of the divorce judgment, the parties\n\nhad joint legal custody with the mother having sole physical custody\n\nsubject to the father's visitation rights. The father's schedule included\n\nvisitation every other weekend, Sunday dinner from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00\n\np.m. on weekends when he did not have visitation, and every Tuesday\n\nnight from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday or the children's return\n\nto school. Both parties had two weeks of summer vacation with the\n\nchildren. The father's child-support obligation was $2,000 per month.\n\nThe father also paid $250 per month for the children's extracurricular\n\nactivities.   The father agreed to pay the children's health-insurance\n\npremiums along with 80% of the children's uncovered medical and dental\n\nexpenses. The father was ordered to pay the mother periodic alimony for\n\nfive years.\n\n      On August 9, 2021, the father filed a petition seeking an order\n\n\n                                    2\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nholding the mother in contempt and seeking a modification of his\n\nvisitation schedule. On September 16, 2021, the mother filed an answer\n\nand a counterclaim seeking an order holding the father in contempt and\n\nseeking a modification of (1) child support, (2) the right to claim certain\n\ntax exemptions for the children, and (3) the father's visitation schedule.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, the father amended his petition, asserting\n\nadditional contempt allegations. On January 21, 2022, the mother filed\n\nan answer to the amended petition. On March 14, 2022, the father filed\n\na second amended petition, asserting additional contempt allegations, to\n\nwhich the mother filed an answer.\n\n     On May 25, 2022, the father filed a motion seeking the children's\n\npassports because, he said, he had planned an overseas trip with the\n\nchildren and the mother had refused to return the passports in violation\n\nof the parties' divorce judgment. On June 8, 2022, the trial court granted\n\nthe motion. Subsequently, the trip was canceled. On June 16, 2022, the\n\nmother filed a motion requesting the return of the passports because, she\n\nsaid, the father's behavior had been \"bizarre\" and there were no current\n\nplans for overseas travel. On June 17, 2022, the trial court ordered the\n\nfather to return the passports to the mother.\n\n\n                                    3\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     On June 23, 2022, the father filed a motion seeking a modification\n\nof the summer-visitation schedule because, he said, the mother had\n\ninterfered with his visitation. Ultimately, the trial court entered an order\n\nallowing the father additional summer visitation because the mother\n\n\"unreasonably and without justification unilaterally\" had denied the\n\nfather certain visitation.\n\n     On February 7, 2023, the father filed a third amended petition\n\nseeking (1) to modify custody so that the parties would have joint physical\n\ncustody, (2) to modify his child-support obligation, and (3) to hold the\n\nmother in contempt for violating the divorce judgment. On April 4, 2023,\n\nthe mother filed a motion for a status conference. On July 17, 2023, the\n\nmother filed an emergency motion for return of one of the children\n\nbecause, she said, the father had not returned the child after the parties\n\nhad swapped visitation days. That same day, the mother filed an\n\namended counterclaim alleging that the father had violated the divorce\n\njudgment. After a hearing, the trial court ordered the father to return\n\nthe child to the mother.\n\n     The trial began on November 2, 2023, and was completed on\n\nNovember 3, 2023. The father testified that the visitation schedule has\n\n\n                                     4\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nbeen a problem since the parties divorced. He stated that the mother had\n\ninterfered with his visitation by taking the children on a trip during his\n\nvisitation weekend and provided other examples of her interference. The\n\nhusband stated that it was difficult to schedule his two summer-vacation\n\nweeks. The husband testified that the wife had \"obstructed\" a lot of\n\nevents. He stated that the wife had made \"unilateral\" decisions with\n\nregard to missing or being late for his visitation with the children.\n\nRegarding the mother's interference with his visitation, the father's\n\ncounsel and the father engaged in the following exchange:\n\n          \"A. Yes. Just some kind of recognition that, you know,\n     my time is to be protected and not interfered with and that I\n     can budget that time as I see fit, you know, for example, it's\n     time to pick up the kids and I'm out of town and I send my\n     mom to pick them up for me, you know, there have been\n     numerous occasions where she's prevented my mom from\n     being able to pick the kids up because she says that she\n     doesn't have to recognize grandparents' rights.\n\n           \"Q. Yes.\n\n           \"A. On my time.\n\n            \"Q. Well, if your mother -- on those times when your\n     mother was not allowed to pick up your children, would you\n     still be able to exercise your visitation or did [the mother]\n     treat it as forfeited?\n\n            \"A. Well, there's been several instances where she was\n     like, you forfeited the whole thing.\"\n\n                                    5\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n\n     The father testified that, to limit \"ping-ponging\" the children back\n\nand forth between the parents' houses, he had originally requested in his\n\npetition that the children stay with him until Wednesday during weeks\n\nwhen he has visitation weekends, because they would be at his house on\n\nTuesday night until Wednesday morning and it would only add a Monday\n\nto his visitation. The father later amended his petition to seek joint\n\nphysical custody.    He explained that he had amended his petition\n\nbecause the mother had continued to interfere with his visitation while\n\nthe action was pending. The father testified that the mother refuses to\n\nspeak with him and that their only communication is through texts and\n\nemails.\n\n     The father testified that the mother, contrary to the divorce\n\njudgment, had made the decision to place the children in counseling\n\nwithout consulting him or telling him that she had done so. The father\n\nfurther stated that one of the children has medical issues requiring\n\ntreatment at Children's Hospital and that the mother would not keep him\n\ninformed of that child's medical appointments. He also said that, when\n\nhe had asked the mother why she had not informed him of one of the\n\nchildren's school performances, the mother had told him to call the\n\n                                   6\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nschool. The father testified that the mother had told the employees at\n\nthe children's schools that he had no right to pick up the children. The\n\nfather testified that the principal had had to be contacted when the father\n\nhad tried to bring one of the children a sports/track watch that the child\n\nhad left at his house. When asked about two cotillion events for one of\n\nthe children, the father explained:\n\n           \"A. Well, there was like two separate -- like a two tiered\n     event on two different dates. And the first one, [the child] told\n     me about after the fact, I think she said, you know, Papa I\n     wanted you to be there but Mom wouldn't let you go so Dada\n     took me which is [the mother's] dad. She said I was the only\n     girl there whose dad wasn't with them. And there was\n     another, like, dance coming up. And so I texted [the mother]\n     about it and I said, hey, … I really want to take her to that.\n     That's an opportunity, that's something I want to do with her.\n     And she refused to let me go. She said [her] parents paid for\n     it, you know, you can't go for that reason. You know, I talked\n     to her dad about it. He didn't care. He was fine with me going.\n     But long story short, [the child] didn't go. She would rather\n     prevent [the child] from going to the dance than me getting to\n     go with her, so [the child] just didn't go at all.\"\n\n     The father testified that when one of the children had asked the\n\nmother for one-week-on and one-week-off visitation with the father, the\n\nmother had \"shut it down.\" He also said that he had reached out to both\n\nthe mother and her father to come to an agreement while this action was\n\npending and that the mother had never responded, although her father\n\n\n                                      7\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nhad responded. The father testified that the children have chores to do\n\nwhile they are at his house and that the children are not supposed to\n\npurchase things without his permission.       The father stated that he\n\nencourages the children to communicate with the mother. When asked\n\nwhether he had input on the children's academics, the father testified:\n\n           \"A. No. For example, [A.B.S.] is approaching, you know,\n     the age, the stage where you begin looking at colleges. I have\n     tried to take her on various college visits, have been told by\n     [the mother] that I can only take her on my time. And I have\n     said to [the mother], you know, [the three younger children],\n     they don't have any interest in going to Oxford, Mississippi to\n     tour Ole' Miss. You know, they're not ready for that yet. It\n     would be a lot easier if I could just take her when [the younger\n     children] are with you. There's no room to have that\n     conversation. I study with the kids. The kids do lean on [the\n     mother] for math. I'm terrible at math, you know. [The\n     mother's] good at it. They lean on her for that, as well as they\n     should. I encourage them to. She's much better at that than\n     I am. But I study with them.\"\n\n     The father testified that his house has four bedrooms to\n\naccommodate the children and that his house and the mother's house are\n\ntwo miles apart. He stated that the children would not be \"uprooted\" by\n\na joint-physical-custody arrangement because the parties live so close to\n\neach other. The father asked for Christmas visitation, that his parents\n\nbe allowed to pick up the children without interference from the mother,\n\nand that the mother reinstate the father as a parent who could check the\n\n                                    8\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nchildren in and out of their schools.\n\n     On cross-examination, the father testified that he had entered into\n\na settlement agreement with the mother that was incorporated into the\n\ntrial court's divorce judgment in 2016. The father stated that he did not\n\nlog in to \"Schoology\" to find out about the children's school because he did\n\nnot have a password, although one of the children had shown the website\n\nto him. The father admitted that he had not paid for the oldest child to\n\ntake a college-exam preparatory class and that he had not signed the\n\nchildren up for activities like \"Summer Showoffs.\" He stated that he had\n\nhelped the children with science projects.\n\n     The father was asked whether he had helped A.B.S., the oldest\n\nchild, purchase an automobile. The following email exchange between\n\nthe mother and the father occurred on February 1, 2023, regarding cars\n\nfor the children:\n\n           \"[The mother]: I received your text message regarding a\n     potential car for [A.B.S.]. At this time [A.B.S.] only has $2,200\n     saved up for a car. Her goal is to have 2,500 saved by her\n     birthday. If you would like to help with the purchase of the\n     car, you can write a check to her up to the matching amount\n     of $2,500. The car title will be in my name until she reaches\n     18. You're welcome to pass along any leads you find on the car\n     and contact information. But she and I will handle the final\n     decision and the purchase. If you change your mind on\n\n\n                                        9\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     assisting her in the purchase financially, please let me know\n     so she can plan accordingly.\n\n           \"[The father]: I'm out then. Not going to be treated like\n     a child. Good luck.\"\n\nThe father admitted that he and the mother had different rules on the\n\nolder children's car usage. The father admitted that he and the mother\n\nalso had different rules on the children's use of cellular telephones. The\n\nfather admitted that he had blocked the mother on his phone and the\n\nchildren's phones because the mother had taken one of the children's\n\nphones away and had not let the child communicate with the father. The\n\nfather admitted that he had taken the children on a number of vacations.\n\nThe father also admitted that the children have used his credit card to\n\npurchase clothing and cosmetics.\n\n     The father testified that he had taxable income of $550,000 in 2021\n\nand $468,980 in 2022.      In 2020, the father had taxable income of\n\n$220,504. The father testified that he was a consultant and that his\n\nincome varies. He stated that he had sold a company investment in 2022,\n\nwhich had increased his taxable income. The father testified that the\n\nmother has a master's degree in education administration but that she\n\nhad not held a job in that field. The father admitted that he had made\n\n\n                                   10\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nmistakes during the parties' marriage.\n\n     The mother testified that she was unsure how many times she had\n\nagreed to the father's requested summer-vacation weeks. She stated that\n\nthe children's schedule and summer camps dictated the availability of his\n\ntwo weeks of summer vacation. The mother could not remember whether\n\nshe had prevented the father's mother from exercising the father's\n\nvisitation with three of the children when the father had taken one of the\n\nchildren on a special trip. The mother admitted that there had been\n\ntimes when the father had not gotten to visit with the children. She\n\nstated that the father had been allowed to make up certain missed\n\nvisitation sessions. The mother admitted that the father had not been\n\nallowed to see the children on Father's Day in 2022, in contravention of\n\nthe divorce judgment. The mother stated that she had not let the father\n\nsee the children the day after that Father's Day either. The mother\n\nadmitted that there was no court order that allowed the mother to make\n\nunilateral decisions regarding the children. The mother admitted that\n\nshe had not told the father about any of the children's \"well-child\" visits\n\nwith their pediatrician. The mother admitted that one of the reasons\n\nthat she had not wanted the father at the child's cotillion events was\n\n\n                                    11\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nbecause her parents had paid for that activity.\n\n     The mother testified that, in 2016, the father had agreed that he\n\nwould have the children for the Thanksgiving holidays and that she\n\nwould have the children over the Christmas holidays. The mother did\n\nnot want to change the current holiday traditions. The mother testified\n\nas to numerous days when the father had returned the children late. The\n\nmother testified that she was not asking the trial court for any\n\nreimbursement for the car for the oldest child. The mother stated that\n\nshe had used that purchase as an opportunity to teach the child how to\n\nbudget, that the child had saved money, and that the maternal\n\ngrandparents had helped the mother to match the money the child had\n\nsaved to purchase the car. The mother testified that the other children\n\nwere going to do the same when purchasing a car. The mother testified\n\nregarding her rules for operating the car and for the use of phones when\n\nthe children were with her.\n\n     The mother testified that she works for \"All Things Ministries,\"\n\nearning $60,000 a year. She said that the job allows her flexibility with\n\nthe children. The trial court admitted an exhibit from the mother, which\n\ncontained a summary of her monthly expenses. Counsel for the mother\n\n\n                                   12\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nsaid that the document contained a summary of information from the\n\nmother's bank statements and that the father had copies of the bank\n\nstatements. 1   The mother estimated that the costs of the children's\n\nmonthly extracurricular activities totaled $1,195.    The mother also\n\nincluded in her summary her house payment, her homeowner's\n\nassociation fees, her utility expenses, the cost of a housekeeper, and\n\nmedical expenses, among other things. The mother also included her\n\ngasoline and car-insurance expenses and the gasoline and car-insurance\n\nexpenses for the child that had purchased a car with her savings. The\n\nmother also included \"car savings,\" which appears to be the cost of\n\n\"matching\" the other children's savings when they are old enough to\n\npurchase and drive a car, as a monthly expense. The mother explained\n\nthat she had added most of the expenses, divided that number by five (to\n\naccount for the mother and the four children), and then multiplied that\n\nnumber by four to calculate what the father should contribute toward the\n\nchildren's monthly expenses to calculate his child-support obligation.\n\nThe mother testified that she wanted $6,200 a month in child support.\n\nThe mother admitted that she had included in her summary and\n\n\n     1The bank statements were not admitted into evidence.\n\n                                  13\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\ncalculations medical expenses, 80% of which the father was already\n\nrequired to reimburse her for. When asked about the children's $1,195\n\nmonthly extracurricular-activity fees, the mother testified that A.B.S.'s\n\nshow-choir fees were $2,000 per year, that S.K.S. had piano lessons\n\ncosting $90 per month, and that L.E.S. played on a soccer team costing\n\n$1,000 per year and a volleyball team costing $600 per year.\n\n     Each of the children testified. A.B.S. testified that she was 16 years\n\nold. During A.B.S.'s testimony, the following exchange occurred between\n\nthe father's counsel and A.B.S. about the visitation schedule:\n\n          \"A. Well, we go to my dad every Tuesday night. And\n     then every other week our weekends swap. And then the\n     weekends we're not with my dad we go to Sunday night dinner\n     with him for a couple of hours.\n\n           \"Q. And do you go, what, Friday afternoon at five o'clock?\n\n           \"A. Five o'clock on Friday.\"\n\nA.B.S. explained that she wanted to change the visitation schedule\n\nbecause it was difficult to \"pack up everything and go see my dad for like\n\none night. And then every other weekend, we have to pack up again.\"\n\nShe said that she had talked with the mother and had told her:\n\n          \"A. At the beginning of summer, I like mentioned to my\n     mom about maybe just trying some new things and like trying\n     a week on and a week off possibly, or even like just adding\n\n                                   14\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     another night to my dad And we didn't really -- I didn't know\n     what that would look like, I wanted to try to spend more time\n     with my dad or make it easier where like we wouldn't have to\n     go back and forth. And I think that's just what me -- and I'm\n     not speaking for my sisters -- by all of us just kind of want is\n     to not go back and forth as much.\"\n\n     A.B.S. testified that, after she had told the mother that she wanted\n\nto change the visitation schedule, the mother had told A.B.S. that she\n\nwas hurt. She stated that the mother had not liked it when L.E.S. had\n\nchosen to stay with the father in July. A.B.S. said that both of her\n\nparents cared for her and were good parents. A.B.S. stated that she\n\nwanted to spend more time with the father.\n\n     M.C.S. testified that she preferred the current schedule.          She\n\ntestified that the current schedule was the easiest because it is their\n\nroutine and she did not want it to change.\n\n     S.K.S. testified that she would like to keep the current schedule.\n\nShe said that, like M.C.S., she was used to the schedule.\n\n     L.E.S. testified that she and her sisters were with the mother or the\n\nfather every weekend and that they go to the father's house on Tuesdays\n\nto spend the night. She said that the sisters had dinner with the father\n\non Sunday nights.   L.E.S. testified that she wanted to spend more time\n\nwith the father. L.E.S. explained that she had difficulty keeping in\n\n                                   15\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\ncontact with the father when she was at the mother's house because the\n\nmother would not let L.E.S. use her own cellular phone. During the\n\nquestioning of L.E.S. by the father's counsel about whether the mother\n\nhad agreed to L.E.S.'s spending additional time with the father last\n\nsummer, the following exchange occurred:\n\n           \"A. So I went to a camp and we were in the -- me and my\n     sister were in the car and I had asked just about some more\n     time with him. And she had gotten upset so she said that she\n     didn't really care if I went to go live with him, so she said when\n     she picked me up from that camp that afternoon it was my\n     choice, so I chose to go home and when I got home to my mom's\n     house, there was a bag full of like my stuff, all my clothes and\n     toiletries and all that by the door. And then I called my dad\n     and he came to pick me up. And then about like two weeks\n     later I got a message telling me that I should come home\n     which I was confused by because she said I had the choice but\n     he would have to pay for everything.\n\n          \"Q. Okay. She told you he would have to pay for\n     everything if you didn't come home?\n\n           \"A. I was registered for some camps, and he had to pay\n     for the camps. And he had to pay for my school supplies and\n     like re-register me for the camps, so he had to pay for it.\n\n          \"Q. Now, when you got [to] her house when your stuff\n     was packed up, did that upset you?\n\n           \"A. Yes, sir. \"\n\nL.E.S. testified that she would like for visitation to be one week with the\n\nfather and one week with the mother. L.E.S. testified that the mother is\n\n                                    16\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\na good mom but that she misses the father. She said that she loves her\n\nparents \"the same.\"\n\n     On January 4, 2024, the father filed a motion to consider a posttrial\n\nmaterial change of circumstances, alleging that the mother had\n\nremarried. On January 4, 2024, the mother filed a motion to strike the\n\nfather's motion. On January 22, 2024, the father filed a response to the\n\nmotion to strike. On February 23, 2024, the mother filed an emergency\n\nmotion for an order directing the father to return A.B.S. The mother\n\nalleged that A.B.S. had left a school show-choir trip to go with the father\n\nand that the father had encouraged A.B.S. to disregard school policies\n\nand procedures. On February 26, 2024, the father filed a motion seeking\n\nan order directing the mother to return the father's name to the children's\n\nschools' \"check in/out lists for the minor children,\" which the trial court\n\nhad orally directed the mother to do during the trial. The father alleged\n\nthat the show choir had been on a trip to Mississippi; that the father had\n\nprovided the school with prior notice that he would pick up the child for\n\na visit to a Mississippi college; and that, because the mother had not\n\ncomplied with the oral directive of the trial court to return the father's\n\nname to the children's schools' permission-to-check-out lists, the child\n\n\n                                    17\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nhad been suspended from show choir.\n\n     On March 7, 2024, the mother filed a second emergency motion for\n\nthe immediate return of A.B.S. On March 8, 2024, the trial court entered\n\nthe following order:\n\n            \"Upon consideration of [the father's] Motion to enter\n     Order Regarding School Check-In/Out, the Court finds that\n     the same is due to be granted. Further, the Court finds that\n     the situation regarding the child being removed from show\n     choir was the fault of [the mother] due to her failure or refusal\n     to follow this Court's Order issued in open court in November\n     of 2023 that she add [the father] to the check-in/check-out list\n     at [the child's] school. Accordingly, it is hereby,\n\n           \"ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\n\n           \"1. The [father's] Motion is GRANTED.\n\n           \"2. If she has not done so already, [the mother] shall\n     immediately add [the father's] name to the check-in/check-out\n     list at every school where a child of the parties is in\n     attendance. This Court hopes the oldest child's school will\n     reconsider and not penalize the minor child by removing her\n     from show choir for an issue that should not have existed but\n     for [the mother's] lack of following an Order of this Court.\"\n\n(Capitalization in original.)\n\n     On April 24, 2024, the mother filed a motion to set an in-person\n\nstatus hearing. On May 3, 2024, the mother filed a renewed motion to set\n\nan in-person status hearing. On May 10, 2024, the trial court entered an\n\norder setting all pending matters for a hearing on May 30, 2024. On June\n\n                                    18\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n20, 2024, the trial court denied the father's motion to consider a posttrial\n\nmaterial change of circumstances. On July 17, 2024, the trial court\n\ndenied the mother's motions for the immediate return of A.B.S.\n\n     On August 2, 2024, the trial court entered a final judgment,\n\nmodifying the father's visitation schedule because the children, who were\n\nages 9, 7, 6, and 4 at the time of the divorce, were now ages 17, 15, 14,\n\nand 12. The trial court found that the visitation schedule needed to be\n\nmodified to reflect the current ages, activities and maturity levels of the\n\nchildren and because of the inability of the parents to agree on many\n\nsignificant matters. The trial court modified the father's visitation\n\nschedule so that, during the school year, the father would have visitation\n\nwith the children every other weekend from Friday after school until\n\n\"Wednesday morning return to school.\"         As set out in the divorce\n\njudgment, the father would continue to have visitation with the children\n\novernight on Tuesday during those weeks when the father did not have\n\nweekend visitation. The trial court awarded the father an additional\n\nthree weeks of summer visitation so that each party had five weeks of\n\nsummer vacation with the children, and the trial court awarded the\n\nfather Christmas-vacation visitation from December 26 to the start of the\n\n\n                                    19\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nschool year in January.\n\n     The trial court vacated its earlier order regarding the children's\n\npassports. The trial court found that any prior concerns of the mother\n\nthat the father would abscond with the children were not supported by\n\nany evidence, and it determined that, considering that the passports had\n\nbeen obtained through the efforts of the father and at his expense and\n\nthat the mother had not used the passports, the previous requirements\n\nregarding the father's use of the passports had proven to be cumbersome\n\nand at times unworkable given the parties' inability to cooperate on such\n\nmatters.\n\n     The trial court's judgment further provided as follows:\n\n           \"2. CHILD SUPPORT:\n\n           \"(a) Child support is currently set at $2,000.00 per\n     month. Evidence was presented through testimony and\n     documents that the father is earning a significantly larger\n     amount of money per year than when the parties entered into\n     the Divorce Agreement, an increase of much more than ten\n     percent. Furthermore, evidence was presented to show that\n     the children's increased needs support a modification of child\n     support. The father's income alone exceeds the upper limits of\n     the Child Support Guidelines calculations of $30,000.00 per\n     month, and the parties' combined monthly income exceeds\n     that amount by more than $10,000.00. As such, the Court\n     finds it is proper to set an amount of child support that\n     exceeds the Child Support Guidelines' uppermost dollar\n\n\n                                   20\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n    amounts, but not at the dollar amounts suggested by counsel\n    for the mother.\n\n          \"(b) Considering and allowing for other financial\n    considerations set out herein, the Court ORDERS that the\n    father shall pay the sum of $5,000.00 per month in child\n    support. retroactive to the first full month after the original\n    date of the filing of [the mother's] Answer and Counterclaim\n    for Contempt and Modification of Child Support and Tax\n    Exemptions, which will be October of 2021 (date of filing was\n    September 16, 2021). This order and calculation thereon\n    ($3,000.00 for 34 months) establishes arrears of $102,000.00.\n    The [father] shall pay the arrears (added to the monthly child\n    support amount) in equal payments of $1,325.00 each month\n    for the next 77 months until the child support arrears are paid\n    off in December of 2030, which coincides with the month the\n    youngest child turns 19. The [father] shall make all child\n    support payments the first (1st) day of each month hereafter,\n    except that the payment for August of 2024 shall be due by\n    August 7, 2024.\n\n         \"(c) Monthly child support payments shall continue until\n    each child reaches the age of 19, shall marry, die or otherwise\n    become emancipated, consistent with the following\n    paragraph.\n\n          \"(d) The first month after the oldest child turns 19, the\n    monthly child support amount shall decrease to $4,300.00 per\n    month. The first month after the next oldest child turns 19,\n    the monthly child support amount shall decrease to $3,600.00\n    per month. The first month after the next oldest child turns\n    19, the monthly child support amount shall decrease to\n    $3,000.00 per month. The father's child support obligations\n    shall terminate with the payment of the December 2030\n    payment.\n\n         \"(e) With input from the mother, the father shall\n    purchase dependable vehicles for his three youngest\n\n                                  21\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n    daughters upon each reaching the age of sixteen. The father\n    shall be responsible for the maintenance, insurance and\n    upkeep for any vehicle driven by his daughters through the\n    age of their majority, even if it means reimbursing the mother\n    for sums paid for those expenses.\n\n          \"3. All provisions of the Judgment and subsequent\n    orders not modified herein shall remain in full force and\n    effect.\n\n          \"4. [The mother] shall make it clear to Auburn City\n    Schools that [the father] has full authority to check the\n    children in or out of school.\n\n          \"5. The parties shall work together so that [the father]\n    has the requisite information so that he may register for\n    notifications from schools, extracurricular activities, and\n    medical providers.\n\n         \"….\n\n          \"7. Both parties are found in contempt for interfering\n    with visitation time, and violating both the letter and the\n    spirit of the Court's prior Orders. Over the years, the Court\n    recalls that the parties have almost never been able to\n    voluntarily agree to adjust their situation to reflect the\n    growth and changing needs of their children and the changing\n    circumstances of each other. The parties have failed or\n    refused to enter into good faith negotiations to amicably\n    resolve matters and avoid having to litigate in court; and\n    stubborn, selfish and contemptuous behavior by one or both\n    parties has inevitably led to the filing of claims and counter-\n    claims, Rule Nisi and contempt actions. Sadly, this behavior\n    has, in the Court's opinion, resulted in the children beginning\n    to take sides and not only using one parent against the other,\n    but also using one or more siblings against the other(s) and a\n    parent. Since this Court's last award of attorney fees against\n    the father, the Court has been unable to keep a running score,\n\n                                  22\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     so to speak, and is unable to determine which party is the\n     most in contempt. As such, the Court here declines to award\n     either party attorney fees or costs for the contempts of the\n     other.\n\n          \"8. Neither party shall schedule a medical or counseling\n     appointment for a child during the custodial time of the other,\n     except by agreement or absolute medical necessity.\n\n            \"9. Each parent is to enforce in his or her home the\n     discipline imposed by the other in her or his home, especially\n     as it relates to the types of discipline universally known to be\n     most effective, such as the deprivation of driving privileges,\n     dispossession of phones and/or electronic devices, and periods\n     of being grounded in the home. Enforcing the dispossession of\n     phones or electronic devices does not encompass prohibiting\n     the child from using the parent's phone to maintain minimal\n     but routine contact with the other parent.\n\n          \"10. Neither party may block the other party on a child's\n     phone, nor disable location services on a child's phone.\n\n           \"11. The mother shall timely inform the father of any\n     medical, academic or religious issues concerning the children,\n     and inform the father of sports or other extracurricular\n     activities involving the children which she may have reason\n     to believe he is unaware.\n\n           \"12. The father shall not travel to the mother's home for\n     any reason other than to facilitate an exchange of the\n     children, unless approved or requested by the mother.\n\n          \"13. Any other relief requested by either party, not\n     addressed herein, is hereby DENIED.\"\n\n(Capitalization in original.)\n\n     On August 28, 2024, the father filed a motion to alter, amend, or\n\n                                   23\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nvacate the judgment, arguing that the evidence presented supported a\n\ncustody modification awarding the parties' joint legal and physical\n\ncustody; that the modification of child support was not supported by the\n\nevidence; that the trial court had erred in awarding retroactive child\n\nsupport; and that the trial court had erred in ordering the father to\n\npurchase automobiles for the children.      On September 2, 2024, the\n\nmother filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment, arguing,\n\namong other things, that the trial court had exceeded its discretion to\n\nessentially \"back door\" or \"work around\" Ex parte McLendon, 455 So. 2d\n\n863 (Ala. 1984), by substantially modifying the father's physical time\n\nwith the children to almost equal physical time even though the father\n\ndid not meet the necessary burden of proof under the McLendon\n\nstandard. In addition, the mother argued that the visitation modification\n\ndid not take into consideration the testimony of two of the four children,\n\nwho each expressed a preference for maintaining the existing visitation\n\nschedule that had been in place for the past eight years.\n\n     On October 28, 2024, the father filed a motion to clarify regarding\n\nthe renewal of the children's passports. On October 30, 2024, the trial\n\ncourt granted the motion to clarify.

The father argues\n\n                                      25\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nthat the trial court essentially agreed that there had been a material\n\nchange in circumstances because the trial court substantially increased\n\nthe father's visitation. The father argues that his visitation schedule is\n\nclose to joint physical custody because, while the children are in school,\n\nthe father has the children six nights of each two-week period and, during\n\nthe remainder of the year, physical custody is approximately divided\n\nequally between the parties. The father argues that the mother had not\n\nfollowed the terms of the divorce judgment, that the mother had\n\nconsistently interfered with the father's visitation rights, that the mother\n\nhad disparaged the father to other parents to the detriment of the\n\nchildren, and that all four children had acknowledged that it was difficult\n\nto go back and forth between the parents for a day or an evening. The\n\nfather argues that a joint-physical-custody arrangement would have\n\nlittle disruptive effect because the children would attend the same\n\nschools and church at either parent's residence.\n\n           \"In reviewing judgments involving determinations of\n     child custody, 'the trial court is in the better position to\n     consider all of the evidence, as well as the many inferences\n     that may be drawn from that evidence, and to decide the issue\n     of custody.'

The\n\nfather's primary argument for the modification was that joint physical\n\ncustody would be convenient for the children. While all four children\n\nacknowledged difficulty in the former visitation schedule, the children\n\n                                    27\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nwere split in their opinions on whether the former visitation schedule\n\nshould be changed.     The trial court granted the father's alternative\n\nrequest for increased visitation, which appears to alleviate the\n\ninconvenience caused by shorter visitation periods.\n\n     With regard to the father's argument that custody should be\n\nmodified because the mother had not complied with the divorce judgment\n\nand the trial court had found that the mother had interfered with his\n\nvisitation rights, we cannot say that the trial court erred.

App. 2002), this court acknowledged that,\n\nalthough the trial court's judgment did not indicate what standard it had\n\napplied to the request for a modification of custody, the trial court had\n\nindicated at a hearing in that case its apparent belief that a change of\n\ncustody would be an appropriate sanction for contempt. 850 So. 2d at 362.\n\nThis court concluded that,\n\n           \"[i]n light of the trial court's failure to indicate in its\n     judgment that it applied [the standard for a modification of\n     custody outlined in Ex parte] McLendon, [455 So. 2d 863 (Ala.\n     1984),] the trial court's comments, and the finding of contempt\n     contained in the judgment, it appears that the trial court\n     changed custody to the father as a sanction for the mother's\n     continued contempt of the visitation provisions of the divorce\n     judgment and subsequent in-court agreements to permit\n     visitation ....\"\n\n\n                                    28\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nId. Moreover, this court noted that, in that case, the record did not\n\ncontain sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that a change of\n\ncustody would materially promote the child's best interests. Id. In the\n\npresent case, the trial court found both parties in contempt for interfering\n\nwith visitation time and violating both the letter and the spirit of its prior\n\norders.\n\n             Child Support and the Purchase of Automobiles\n\n     The father argues that the trial court erred in modifying child\n\nsupport because, he says,\n\n     \"the evidence [the mother] presented regarding her request\n     for the modification of child support was almost exclusively\n     limited to the increase in the income of the parties.8 No\n     evidence was presented concerning the lifestyle of the parties\n     or their children prior to the divorce. At best, the trial court\n     was made aware of the parties' respective incomes at the time\n     of the divorce, [the father] was employed and earning\n     approximately $122,000.00 per year, and [the mother] was not\n     employed outside of the home. … No testimony or other\n     evidence was presented concerning the lifestyle to which the\n     children were accustomed and the standard of living enjoyed\n     before the parties were divorced.\n\n           \"[The mother] presented no testimony or other evidence,\n     certainly not substantial evidence, of the reasonable and\n     necessary needs of the children, an increase in those needs, or\n     an increase in the reasonable and necessary expenses of the\n     minor children. [The mother] offered her alleged average\n     monthly expenses; however, the amount of said expenses and\n     who paid the expenses was certainly called into question. …\n\n                                     29\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     [The mother] offered nothing to suggest her average monthly\n     expenses or those of the children had increased since the\n     Judgment. The trial court's finding that 'the costs of raising\n     the children have increased,' … appears to be more of a\n     general statement, as no such evidence was presented.\n\n           \"The one item that [the mother] might suggest could be\n     evidence in support of her request was the allegation of the\n     children's monthly activity expense being $1,195.00 per\n     month; however, on cross examination, [the mother] provided\n     no support for the alleged expenses. … Even if the allegation\n     of a monthly activity expense of $1,195.00 was supported by\n     substantial evidence, and it is not, no evidence was presented\n     to suggest that the monthly activity expense had increased.\n     ____________________\n\n          \"8More specifically, the increase in [the father's] income.\n     [The mother] all but ignored the increase in her own income.\n     The trial court also ignored the increase in [the mother's]\n     income….\"\n\nThe father's brief at 36-38. The father also argues that the trial court's\n\nordering him to purchase \"dependable vehicles\" for each child upon\n\nreaching the age of sixteen and to be responsible for insurance and\n\nmaintenance on the vehicles was an abuse of discretion and not\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n     It is undisputed that the parties' combined adjusted gross income\n\nexceeded the uppermost limit of the Rule 32, Ala. R. Jud. Admin., child-\n\nsupport guidelines. The mother was earning $60,000 a year, and the\n\nfather had income of $550,000 in 2021 and $468,980 in 2022.\n\n                                   30\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n           \"When the combined adjusted gross income exceeds the\n     uppermost limit of the child support schedule, the amount of\n     child support awarded must rationally relate to the\n     reasonable and necessary needs of the child, taking into\n     account the lifestyle to which the child was accustomed and\n     the standard of living the child enjoyed before the divorce, and\n     must reasonably relate to the obligor's ability to pay for those\n     needs.

Young, 322 So. 3d 520, 525 (Ala. Civ. App. 2020) (plurality\n\nopinion).\n\n     In the present case, the trial court increased the father's child-\n\nsupport obligation from $2,000 to $5,000 because the father was earning\n\na significantly larger amount of money per year than when the divorce\n\njudgment had been entered and \"evidence was presented to to show that\n\n                                    31\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nthe children's increased needs\" supported a modification of child support.\n\n\"A trial court exceeds its discretion when it increases a party's child-\n\nsupport obligation without any evidence to support that a material\n\nchange has occurred.\" Broadway v.

Civ.\n\nApp. 2018).   In addition to increased child support, the trial court also\n\nordered the father to purchase, insure, and maintain cars for the\n\nchildren. See Bittick v.

This court found that the\n\nhusband was not responsible for specific costs when no evidence of those\n\ncosts was presented. This court explained:\n\n           \"When the parents' combined monthly income exceeds\n     the uppermost limit of the Rule 32[, Ala. R. Jud.

' \"The award of child support must rationally\n     relate to the reasonable and necessary needs of the child,\n     taking into account the lifestyle to which the child was\n     accustomed and the standard of living the child enjoyed before\n     the divorce ....\" ' Bittick, 297 So. 3d at 402 (quoting Brasfield\n     v. Brasfield, 679 So. 2d 1091, 1094 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996)).\n\n           \"According to the husband, the only evidence of the\n     children's living expenses was the wife's testimony indicating\n     that she had calculated her living expenses to be $22,000 per\n     month, including 'mortgage, food, day care, extended care,\n     clothing, laundry, telephone bill, internet bill, gas, electricity,\n     cable, water, school lunches, medical psychiatric care, dental\n     care, prescription drugs, auto insurance, and life insurance,'\n     adding that she 'still [did not] have the numbers on medical\n     insurance and car payment.' Based on other evidence\n     submitted at trial, the monthly mortgage payment on the\n     marital residence was $5,249.49; however, that house was to\n     be sold pursuant to the amended divorce judgment, and the\n     mortgage payments were to be made by the husband until the\n\n                                     33\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n    sale of that residence. Also, the outstanding debt on the\n    Mercedes, which the wife used to transport the children, was\n    approximately $19,000, with a payment of $800 per month,\n    and the husband likewise was responsible for that debt, in\n    addition to his child-support obligation. Nevertheless, in\n    considering the issue of child support, the trial court could\n    consider the lifestyle to which the children were accustomed,\n    see id., particularly, the fact that the marital residence was\n    not to be the permanent residence for the children and the\n    wife would have to obtain another residence for herself and\n    the children. However, the record contains no discussion of\n    where the wife and children might reside after they moved\n    from the marital residence and contains little discussion of\n    the specific needs of the children or the costs associated with\n    their care beyond the son's day-care expense of $1,200 per\n    month, which was scheduled to end in the fall of 2020 when\n    he began kindergarten, statements that spending for the\n    children's clothes was a few hundred dollars every few\n    months, and a discussion of certain past-due amounts that\n    were not discussed in terms of monthly costs. As noted, the\n    husband was otherwise responsible for one-half of the\n    children's extracurricular-activity expenses and for the\n    payment of the children's health insurance, which was $550\n    per month, and the costs of the daughter's counseling, for\n    which no evidence of cost was presented. Thus, those expenses\n    may not be considered as part of the children's expenses\n    included within the $7,050 child-support award. See Bittick,\n    297 So. 3d at 403 ('[I]n light of the fact that the judgment\n    requires the father to pay 50% of such expenses, those\n    expenses should be deducted from the mother's statement of\n    the children's expenses.').\n\n          \"Based on the foregoing, we agree with the husband that\n    the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the\n    children required $7,050 from him -- in addition to the\n    expenses of the children that the amended divorce judgment\n    otherwise obligated him to pay -- for their reasonable and\n    necessary needs. Accordingly, ' \" 'we reverse the portion of the\n\n                                  34\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     judgment setting an amount of child support and remand for\n     further proceedings that will allow the court to determine the\n     reasonable and necessary needs of the [children].' \" ' Tyson v.\n     Tyson, 21 So. 3d 7, 10 (Ala.

App.\n     1999), reversed on other grounds, 782 So. 2d 308 (Ala. 2000)).\"\n\nPrakash, 331 So. 3d at 1168-70 (footnotes omitted).\n\n     The mother presented a document that contained a summary of her\n\ncurrent monthly expenses to support her request for increased child\n\nsupport. Those expenses included a 4/5 portion of the mother's monthly\n\nexpenses for automobile insurance, gasoline, utilities, pest control, a\n\nhousekeeper,     homeowner's     association    fees,    the    children's\n\nextracurricular activities, groceries, her saving for the purchase of\n\nautomobiles, her mortgage payment, house maintenance, vacation\n\nexpenses, entertainment, clothing, haircuts, and other incidentals. The\n\nmother included all of the oldest child's car-insurance and gasoline\n\nexpenses.   The mother also included all the counseling fees for the\n\nchildren along with the cost of their prescription medications as part of\n\nher monthly expenses.\n\n     We are unable to discern how the trial court determined the amount\n\nof the increase in child support or come to the conclusion that the father\n\n\n                                   35\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nshould be required to purchase cars along with paying for car-related\n\nexpenses. First, not all of the mother's claimed monthly expenses appear\n\nto be supported by the record. For example, the mother claimed that the\n\nchildren had expenses of $1,195 a month for extracurricular activities.\n\nWhen asked about the expenses, the mother stated that show-choir cost\n\n$2,000 a year, that soccer cost $1,000 a year, that volleyball cost $600 a\n\nyear, and that piano lessons cost $90 a month, which amounts to $390\n\nper month ($2,000 divided by 12 is $167; $1,000 divided by 12 is $83; and\n\n$600 divided by 12 is $50).   Also, the mother included certain medical\n\nexpenses as her expenses, but she admitted 80% of those expenses were\n\nto be reimbursed by the father under the divorce judgment. It does not\n\nappear that the trial court considered that the father, while paying\n\n$2,000 a month in child support, had also paid an additional $250 per\n\nmonth for the children's activities since the parties divorced in 2016.\n\nSecond, it appears that some of the expenses the mother claimed in her\n\nchild-support request regarding automobiles for the children duplicate\n\nthe trial court's mandate that the father purchase, maintain, and insure\n\ncars for the children. Therefore, we reverse the portion of the judgment\n\nsetting an amount of child support and requiring the father to purchase\n\n\n                                   36\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nautomobiles and pay car-related expenses for the entry of a judgment\n\nthat will allow this court to determine whether the trial court's award\n\nprovides for the reasonable and necessary needs of the children.\n\n                       Retroactive Child Support\n\n     The father argues that the trial court erred in awarding the mother\n\nretroactive child support because, he says, (1) the mother did not request\n\nretroactive support, (2) the father had provided support pursuant to the\n\nparties' agreement incorporated into the 2016 divorce judgment, (3) the\n\nmother presented no evidence concerning the children's needs or\n\nexpenses during the period for which the retroactive child support was\n\nawarded, and (4) the mother did not present evidence indicating that the\n\nchildren were not \"provided for\" during the period for which the\n\nretroactive child support was awarded.\n\n     In Brown v. Brown, 719 So. 2d 228 (Ala. Civ. App. 1998), a divorce\n\naction, the trial court ordered the husband in that case to pay child\n\nsupport and a child-support arrearage of $7,500. Although the trial court\n\nhad never entered a pendente lite child-support order in the case, it was\n\nundisputed that the husband had voluntarily paid $100 per week in child\n\nsupport during the first year after the parties separated in June 1995.\n\n\n                                   37\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nThe husband paid no child support from June 1996 until the divorce\n\njudgment was entered in July 1997. The husband argued that the trial\n\ncourt had erred in awarding the wife a $7,500 \"arrearage\" in child\n\nsupport for the period of June 1996 to July 1997 when the trial court had\n\nnever entered a pendente lite child-support order. The husband also\n\nargued that the arrearage award was arbitrary and without support in\n\nthe record. This court disagreed, writing:\n\n           \"In cases seeking modification of child support, it is\n     within the discretion of the trial court to make any\n     modification retroactive to the date of the filing of the petition\n     for the modification.

Dunnavant,\n     668 So. 2d 851 (Ala. Civ. App. 1995). In cases that involve an\n     award of post-minority support for a college eduction, this\n     court has held that the award of such support will be\n     retroactive to the date of the filing of the petition for the\n     support. Thompson v. Thompson, 689 So. 2d 885 (Ala. Civ.\n     App. 1997) (citing Bayliss v. Bayliss, 575 So. 2d 1117 (Ala. Civ.\n     App. 1990)). In Thompson, this court quoted a Pennsylvania\n     court and concluded that: 'There is a sound policy favoring\n     retroactivity in most cases, because the party entitled to\n     support should not be penalized for having to resort to time-\n     consuming court proceedings.' 689 So. 2d at 889 (citation\n     omitted). Finally, the Alabama legislature recognized the\n     parent's duty to support a child and created a cause of action\n     for retroactive support. See §§ 30-3-110 et seq., Ala. Code\n     1975.\n\n          \"Given this state's policy and law requiring a parent to\n     support a minor child, we hold that a trial court may, in its\n\n                                    38\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     discretion, award child support retroactive to the filing of the\n     complaint for divorce where the trial court has failed to enter\n     a pendente lite child support order for the period in which the\n     parent had a duty to support the child but failed to provide\n     that support. In future cases, when awarding retroactive\n     support, the trial court should state its reasons for the award,\n     the factors it considered, and the manner in which it\n     calculated the retroactive support award.\n\n          \"We emphasize that this holding is not meant to\n     eliminate the use of pendente lite orders for temporary child\n     support during the pendency of divorce proceedings. Parents\n     have a duty to support their minor children; the trial courts\n     should rule on a request for temporary child support as\n     expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nBrown, 719 So. 2d at 232 (emphasis added). \"The determination whether\n\nan award of retroactive child support is appropriate is dependent on the\n\nspecific facts of the case.\" Willis v. Willis, 45 So. 3d 347, 349 (Ala. Civ.\n\nApp. 2010).\n\n     In S.A.M. v. M.H.W., 227 So. 3d 1232 (Ala. Civ. App. 2017), the\n\nfather in that case contended on appeal that the mother's request for\n\nretroactive child support had been, in fact, an amendment to her\n\ncounterclaim for which she had not properly sought leave under Rule\n\n15(a), Ala. R. Civ. P. This court held that the issue was properly before\n\nus, explaining:\n\n     \"The father might be correct that the mother's motion seeking\n     retroactive child support should have been presented not by\n\n                                    39\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     motion but by an amendment to her counterclaim. See Walker\n     v. Walker, 695 So. 2d 58, 60 (Ala. Civ. App. 1997) (concluding\n     that a request for retroactive child support was a compulsory\n     counterclaim to a divorce complaint). He is correct that any\n     amendment to the mother's counterclaim would have\n     required leave of court because the case had been first set for\n     trial in January 2016. See Rule 15(a)[, Ala. R. Civ. P.] (stating\n     that 'a party may amend a pleading only by leave of court, and\n     leave shall be given only upon a showing of good cause,' if an\n     amendment is made less than 42 days before the initial\n     setting of the case for trial); see also Austin v.

However,\n     we cannot agree with the father that the issue of retroactive\n     child support was not properly before the juvenile court. The\n     issue of retroactive child support was raised at trial without\n     objection, and, therefore, even if not properly pleaded, it was\n     tried by the implied consent of the parties. See Rule 15(b), Ala.\n     R. Civ. P.\"\n\nS.A.M., 227 So. 3d at 1233.\n\n     In the present case, the mother did not request retroactive child\n\nsupport in her counterclaim or amended counterclaim. The issue of\n\nretroactive child support was not addressed during the trial. At trial, the\n\nmother asked for an increase in child support based on her monthly\n\nexpenses. There was no testimony that the children were not provided\n\nfor while her request for an increase in child support was pending. The\n\n\n                                     40\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\ntestimony regarding the mother's expenses was not sufficient to indicate\n\nthat the issue of retroactivity was tried by implied consent.

(&quot;the father&quot;) appeals from a judgment entered by the Lee\n\nCircuit Court (&quot;the trial court&quot;) in an action in which he sought to modify\n\nthe judgment that had divorced him from S.G.S. (&quot;the mother&quot;). We\n\naffirm in part and reverse in part.\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n                              Background\n\n      The father and the mother divorced on November 28, 2016. The\n\ndivorce judgment incorporated a settlement agreement between the\n\nparties. Four children, all daughters, were born of the marriage: A.B.S.\n\n(born in 2007), M.C.S. (born in 2009), L.E.S. (born in 2010), and S.K.S.\n\n(born in 2011). Pursuant to the terms of the divorce judgment, the parties\n\nhad joint legal custody with the mother having sole physical custody\n\nsubject to the father&#x27;s visitation rights. The father&#x27;s schedule included\n\nvisitation every other weekend, Sunday dinner from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00\n\np.m. on weekends when he did not have visitation, and every Tuesday\n\nnight from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday or the children&#x27;s return\n\nto school. Both parties had two weeks of summer vacation with the\n\nchildren. The father&#x27;s child-support obligation was $2,000 per month.\n\nThe father also paid $250 per month for the children&#x27;s extracurricular\n\nactivities.   The father agreed to pay the children&#x27;s health-insurance\n\npremiums along with 80% of the children&#x27;s uncovered medical and dental\n\nexpenses. The father was ordered to pay the mother periodic alimony for\n\nfive years.\n\n      On August 9, 2021, the father filed a petition seeking an order\n\n\n                                    2\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nholding the mother in contempt and seeking a modification of his\n\nvisitation schedule. On September 16, 2021, the mother filed an answer\n\nand a counterclaim seeking an order holding the father in contempt and\n\nseeking a modification of (1) child support, (2) the right to claim certain\n\ntax exemptions for the children, and (3) the father&#x27;s visitation schedule.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, the father amended his petition, asserting\n\nadditional contempt allegations. On January 21, 2022, the mother filed\n\nan answer to the amended petition. On March 14, 2022, the father filed\n\na second amended petition, asserting additional contempt allegations, to\n\nwhich the mother filed an answer.\n\n     On May 25, 2022, the father filed a motion seeking the children&#x27;s\n\npassports because, he said, he had planned an overseas trip with the\n\nchildren and the mother had refused to return the passports in violation\n\nof the parties&#x27; divorce judgment. On June 8, 2022, the trial court granted\n\nthe motion. Subsequently, the trip was canceled. On June 16, 2022, the\n\nmother filed a motion requesting the return of the passports because, she\n\nsaid, the father&#x27;s behavior had been &quot;bizarre&quot; and there were no current\n\nplans for overseas travel. On June 17, 2022, the trial court ordered the\n\nfather to return the passports to the mother.\n\n\n                                    3\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     On June 23, 2022, the father filed a motion seeking a modification\n\nof the summer-visitation schedule because, he said, the mother had\n\ninterfered with his visitation. Ultimately, the trial court entered an order\n\nallowing the father additional summer visitation because the mother\n\n&quot;unreasonably and without justification unilaterally&quot; had denied the\n\nfather certain visitation.\n\n     On February 7, 2023, the father filed a third amended petition\n\nseeking (1) to modify custody so that the parties would have joint physical\n\ncustody, (2) to modify his child-support obligation, and (3) to hold the\n\nmother in contempt for violating the divorce judgment. On April 4, 2023,\n\nthe mother filed a motion for a status conference. On July 17, 2023, the\n\nmother filed an emergency motion for return of one of the children\n\nbecause, she said, the father had not returned the child after the parties\n\nhad swapped visitation days. That same day, the mother filed an\n\namended counterclaim alleging that the father had violated the divorce\n\njudgment. After a hearing, the trial court ordered the father to return\n\nthe child to the mother.\n\n     The trial began on November 2, 2023, and was completed on\n\nNovember 3, 2023. The father testified that the visitation schedule has\n\n\n                                     4\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nbeen a problem since the parties divorced. He stated that the mother had\n\ninterfered with his visitation by taking the children on a trip during his\n\nvisitation weekend and provided other examples of her interference. The\n\nhusband stated that it was difficult to schedule his two summer-vacation\n\nweeks. The husband testified that the wife had &quot;obstructed&quot; a lot of\n\nevents. He stated that the wife had made &quot;unilateral&quot; decisions with\n\nregard to missing or being late for his visitation with the children.\n\nRegarding the mother&#x27;s interference with his visitation, the father&#x27;s\n\ncounsel and the father engaged in the following exchange:\n\n          &quot;A. Yes. Just some kind of recognition that, you know,\n     my time is to be protected and not interfered with and that I\n     can budget that time as I see fit, you know, for example, it&#x27;s\n     time to pick up the kids and I&#x27;m out of town and I send my\n     mom to pick them up for me, you know, there have been\n     numerous occasions where she&#x27;s prevented my mom from\n     being able to pick the kids up because she says that she\n     doesn&#x27;t have to recognize grandparents&#x27; rights.\n\n           &quot;Q. Yes.\n\n           &quot;A. On my time.\n\n            &quot;Q. Well, if your mother -- on those times when your\n     mother was not allowed to pick up your children, would you\n     still be able to exercise your visitation or did [the mother]\n     treat it as forfeited?\n\n            &quot;A. Well, there&#x27;s been several instances where she was\n     like, you forfeited the whole thing.&quot;\n\n                                    5\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n\n     The father testified that, to limit &quot;ping-ponging&quot; the children back\n\nand forth between the parents&#x27; houses, he had originally requested in his\n\npetition that the children stay with him until Wednesday during weeks\n\nwhen he has visitation weekends, because they would be at his house on\n\nTuesday night until Wednesday morning and it would only add a Monday\n\nto his visitation. The father later amended his petition to seek joint\n\nphysical custody.    He explained that he had amended his petition\n\nbecause the mother had continued to interfere with his visitation while\n\nthe action was pending. The father testified that the mother refuses to\n\nspeak with him and that their only communication is through texts and\n\nemails.\n\n     The father testified that the mother, contrary to the divorce\n\njudgment, had made the decision to place the children in counseling\n\nwithout consulting him or telling him that she had done so. The father\n\nfurther stated that one of the children has medical issues requiring\n\ntreatment at Children&#x27;s Hospital and that the mother would not keep him\n\ninformed of that child&#x27;s medical appointments. He also said that, when\n\nhe had asked the mother why she had not informed him of one of the\n\nchildren&#x27;s school performances, the mother had told him to call the\n\n                                   6\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nschool. The father testified that the mother had told the employees at\n\nthe children&#x27;s schools that he had no right to pick up the children. The\n\nfather testified that the principal had had to be contacted when the father\n\nhad tried to bring one of the children a sports/track watch that the child\n\nhad left at his house. When asked about two cotillion events for one of\n\nthe children, the father explained:\n\n           &quot;A. Well, there was like two separate -- like a two tiered\n     event on two different dates. And the first one, [the child] told\n     me about after the fact, I think she said, you know, Papa I\n     wanted you to be there but Mom wouldn&#x27;t let you go so Dada\n     took me which is [the mother&#x27;s] dad. She said I was the only\n     girl there whose dad wasn&#x27;t with them. And there was\n     another, like, dance coming up. And so I texted [the mother]\n     about it and I said, hey, … I really want to take her to that.\n     That&#x27;s an opportunity, that&#x27;s something I want to do with her.\n     And she refused to let me go. She said [her] parents paid for\n     it, you know, you can&#x27;t go for that reason. You know, I talked\n     to her dad about it. He didn&#x27;t care. He was fine with me going.\n     But long story short, [the child] didn&#x27;t go. She would rather\n     prevent [the child] from going to the dance than me getting to\n     go with her, so [the child] just didn&#x27;t go at all.&quot;\n\n     The father testified that when one of the children had asked the\n\nmother for one-week-on and one-week-off visitation with the father, the\n\nmother had &quot;shut it down.&quot; He also said that he had reached out to both\n\nthe mother and her father to come to an agreement while this action was\n\npending and that the mother had never responded, although her father\n\n\n                                      7\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nhad responded. The father testified that the children have chores to do\n\nwhile they are at his house and that the children are not supposed to\n\npurchase things without his permission.       The father stated that he\n\nencourages the children to communicate with the mother. When asked\n\nwhether he had input on the children&#x27;s academics, the father testified:\n\n           &quot;A. No. For example, [A.B.S.] is approaching, you know,\n     the age, the stage where you begin looking at colleges. I have\n     tried to take her on various college visits, have been told by\n     [the mother] that I can only take her on my time. And I have\n     said to [the mother], you know, [the three younger children],\n     they don&#x27;t have any interest in going to Oxford, Mississippi to\n     tour Ole&#x27; Miss. You know, they&#x27;re not ready for that yet. It\n     would be a lot easier if I could just take her when [the younger\n     children] are with you. There&#x27;s no room to have that\n     conversation. I study with the kids. The kids do lean on [the\n     mother] for math. I&#x27;m terrible at math, you know. [The\n     mother&#x27;s] good at it. They lean on her for that, as well as they\n     should. I encourage them to. She&#x27;s much better at that than\n     I am. But I study with them.&quot;\n\n     The father testified that his house has four bedrooms to\n\naccommodate the children and that his house and the mother&#x27;s house are\n\ntwo miles apart. He stated that the children would not be &quot;uprooted&quot; by\n\na joint-physical-custody arrangement because the parties live so close to\n\neach other. The father asked for Christmas visitation, that his parents\n\nbe allowed to pick up the children without interference from the mother,\n\nand that the mother reinstate the father as a parent who could check the\n\n                                    8\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nchildren in and out of their schools.\n\n     On cross-examination, the father testified that he had entered into\n\na settlement agreement with the mother that was incorporated into the\n\ntrial court&#x27;s divorce judgment in 2016. The father stated that he did not\n\nlog in to &quot;Schoology&quot; to find out about the children&#x27;s school because he did\n\nnot have a password, although one of the children had shown the website\n\nto him. The father admitted that he had not paid for the oldest child to\n\ntake a college-exam preparatory class and that he had not signed the\n\nchildren up for activities like &quot;Summer Showoffs.&quot; He stated that he had\n\nhelped the children with science projects.\n\n     The father was asked whether he had helped A.B.S., the oldest\n\nchild, purchase an automobile. The following email exchange between\n\nthe mother and the father occurred on February 1, 2023, regarding cars\n\nfor the children:\n\n           &quot;[The mother]: I received your text message regarding a\n     potential car for [A.B.S.]. At this time [A.B.S.] only has $2,200\n     saved up for a car. Her goal is to have 2,500 saved by her\n     birthday. If you would like to help with the purchase of the\n     car, you can write a check to her up to the matching amount\n     of $2,500. The car title will be in my name until she reaches\n     18. You&#x27;re welcome to pass along any leads you find on the car\n     and contact information. But she and I will handle the final\n     decision and the purchase. If you change your mind on\n\n\n                                        9\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     assisting her in the purchase financially, please let me know\n     so she can plan accordingly.\n\n           &quot;[The father]: I&#x27;m out then. Not going to be treated like\n     a child. Good luck.&quot;\n\nThe father admitted that he and the mother had different rules on the\n\nolder children&#x27;s car usage. The father admitted that he and the mother\n\nalso had different rules on the children&#x27;s use of cellular telephones. The\n\nfather admitted that he had blocked the mother on his phone and the\n\nchildren&#x27;s phones because the mother had taken one of the children&#x27;s\n\nphones away and had not let the child communicate with the father. The\n\nfather admitted that he had taken the children on a number of vacations.\n\nThe father also admitted that the children have used his credit card to\n\npurchase clothing and cosmetics.\n\n     The father testified that he had taxable income of $550,000 in 2021\n\nand $468,980 in 2022.      In 2020, the father had taxable income of\n\n$220,504. The father testified that he was a consultant and that his\n\nincome varies. He stated that he had sold a company investment in 2022,\n\nwhich had increased his taxable income. The father testified that the\n\nmother has a master&#x27;s degree in education administration but that she\n\nhad not held a job in that field. The father admitted that he had made\n\n\n                                   10\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nmistakes during the parties&#x27; marriage.\n\n     The mother testified that she was unsure how many times she had\n\nagreed to the father&#x27;s requested summer-vacation weeks. She stated that\n\nthe children&#x27;s schedule and summer camps dictated the availability of his\n\ntwo weeks of summer vacation. The mother could not remember whether\n\nshe had prevented the father&#x27;s mother from exercising the father&#x27;s\n\nvisitation with three of the children when the father had taken one of the\n\nchildren on a special trip. The mother admitted that there had been\n\ntimes when the father had not gotten to visit with the children. She\n\nstated that the father had been allowed to make up certain missed\n\nvisitation sessions. The mother admitted that the father had not been\n\nallowed to see the children on Father&#x27;s Day in 2022, in contravention of\n\nthe divorce judgment. The mother stated that she had not let the father\n\nsee the children the day after that Father&#x27;s Day either. The mother\n\nadmitted that there was no court order that allowed the mother to make\n\nunilateral decisions regarding the children. The mother admitted that\n\nshe had not told the father about any of the children&#x27;s &quot;well-child&quot; visits\n\nwith their pediatrician. The mother admitted that one of the reasons\n\nthat she had not wanted the father at the child&#x27;s cotillion events was\n\n\n                                    11\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nbecause her parents had paid for that activity.\n\n     The mother testified that, in 2016, the father had agreed that he\n\nwould have the children for the Thanksgiving holidays and that she\n\nwould have the children over the Christmas holidays. The mother did\n\nnot want to change the current holiday traditions. The mother testified\n\nas to numerous days when the father had returned the children late. The\n\nmother testified that she was not asking the trial court for any\n\nreimbursement for the car for the oldest child. The mother stated that\n\nshe had used that purchase as an opportunity to teach the child how to\n\nbudget, that the child had saved money, and that the maternal\n\ngrandparents had helped the mother to match the money the child had\n\nsaved to purchase the car. The mother testified that the other children\n\nwere going to do the same when purchasing a car. The mother testified\n\nregarding her rules for operating the car and for the use of phones when\n\nthe children were with her.\n\n     The mother testified that she works for &quot;All Things Ministries,&quot;\n\nearning $60,000 a year. She said that the job allows her flexibility with\n\nthe children. The trial court admitted an exhibit from the mother, which\n\ncontained a summary of her monthly expenses. Counsel for the mother\n\n\n                                   12\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nsaid that the document contained a summary of information from the\n\nmother&#x27;s bank statements and that the father had copies of the bank\n\nstatements. 1   The mother estimated that the costs of the children&#x27;s\n\nmonthly extracurricular activities totaled $1,195.    The mother also\n\nincluded in her summary her house payment, her homeowner&#x27;s\n\nassociation fees, her utility expenses, the cost of a housekeeper, and\n\nmedical expenses, among other things. The mother also included her\n\ngasoline and car-insurance expenses and the gasoline and car-insurance\n\nexpenses for the child that had purchased a car with her savings. The\n\nmother also included &quot;car savings,&quot; which appears to be the cost of\n\n&quot;matching&quot; the other children&#x27;s savings when they are old enough to\n\npurchase and drive a car, as a monthly expense. The mother explained\n\nthat she had added most of the expenses, divided that number by five (to\n\naccount for the mother and the four children), and then multiplied that\n\nnumber by four to calculate what the father should contribute toward the\n\nchildren&#x27;s monthly expenses to calculate his child-support obligation.\n\nThe mother testified that she wanted $6,200 a month in child support.\n\nThe mother admitted that she had included in her summary and\n\n\n     1The bank statements were not admitted into evidence.\n\n                                  13\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\ncalculations medical expenses, 80% of which the father was already\n\nrequired to reimburse her for. When asked about the children&#x27;s $1,195\n\nmonthly extracurricular-activity fees, the mother testified that A.B.S.&#x27;s\n\nshow-choir fees were $2,000 per year, that S.K.S. had piano lessons\n\ncosting $90 per month, and that L.E.S. played on a soccer team costing\n\n$1,000 per year and a volleyball team costing $600 per year.\n\n     Each of the children testified. A.B.S. testified that she was 16 years\n\nold. During A.B.S.&#x27;s testimony, the following exchange occurred between\n\nthe father&#x27;s counsel and A.B.S. about the visitation schedule:\n\n          &quot;A. Well, we go to my dad every Tuesday night. And\n     then every other week our weekends swap. And then the\n     weekends we&#x27;re not with my dad we go to Sunday night dinner\n     with him for a couple of hours.\n\n           &quot;Q. And do you go, what, Friday afternoon at five o&#x27;clock?\n\n           &quot;A. Five o&#x27;clock on Friday.&quot;\n\nA.B.S. explained that she wanted to change the visitation schedule\n\nbecause it was difficult to &quot;pack up everything and go see my dad for like\n\none night. And then every other weekend, we have to pack up again.&quot;\n\nShe said that she had talked with the mother and had told her:\n\n          &quot;A. At the beginning of summer, I like mentioned to my\n     mom about maybe just trying some new things and like trying\n     a week on and a week off possibly, or even like just adding\n\n                                   14\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     another night to my dad And we didn&#x27;t really -- I didn&#x27;t know\n     what that would look like, I wanted to try to spend more time\n     with my dad or make it easier where like we wouldn&#x27;t have to\n     go back and forth. And I think that&#x27;s just what me -- and I&#x27;m\n     not speaking for my sisters -- by all of us just kind of want is\n     to not go back and forth as much.&quot;\n\n     A.B.S. testified that, after she had told the mother that she wanted\n\nto change the visitation schedule, the mother had told A.B.S. that she\n\nwas hurt. She stated that the mother had not liked it when L.E.S. had\n\nchosen to stay with the father in July. A.B.S. said that both of her\n\nparents cared for her and were good parents. A.B.S. stated that she\n\nwanted to spend more time with the father.\n\n     M.C.S. testified that she preferred the current schedule.          She\n\ntestified that the current schedule was the easiest because it is their\n\nroutine and she did not want it to change.\n\n     S.K.S. testified that she would like to keep the current schedule.\n\nShe said that, like M.C.S., she was used to the schedule.\n\n     L.E.S. testified that she and her sisters were with the mother or the\n\nfather every weekend and that they go to the father&#x27;s house on Tuesdays\n\nto spend the night. She said that the sisters had dinner with the father\n\non Sunday nights.   L.E.S. testified that she wanted to spend more time\n\nwith the father. L.E.S. explained that she had difficulty keeping in\n\n                                   15\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\ncontact with the father when she was at the mother&#x27;s house because the\n\nmother would not let L.E.S. use her own cellular phone. During the\n\nquestioning of L.E.S. by the father&#x27;s counsel about whether the mother\n\nhad agreed to L.E.S.&#x27;s spending additional time with the father last\n\nsummer, the following exchange occurred:\n\n           &quot;A. So I went to a camp and we were in the -- me and my\n     sister were in the car and I had asked just about some more\n     time with him. And she had gotten upset so she said that she\n     didn&#x27;t really care if I went to go live with him, so she said when\n     she picked me up from that camp that afternoon it was my\n     choice, so I chose to go home and when I got home to my mom&#x27;s\n     house, there was a bag full of like my stuff, all my clothes and\n     toiletries and all that by the door. And then I called my dad\n     and he came to pick me up. And then about like two weeks\n     later I got a message telling me that I should come home\n     which I was confused by because she said I had the choice but\n     he would have to pay for everything.\n\n          &quot;Q. Okay. She told you he would have to pay for\n     everything if you didn&#x27;t come home?\n\n           &quot;A. I was registered for some camps, and he had to pay\n     for the camps. And he had to pay for my school supplies and\n     like re-register me for the camps, so he had to pay for it.\n\n          &quot;Q. Now, when you got [to] her house when your stuff\n     was packed up, did that upset you?\n\n           &quot;A. Yes, sir. &quot;\n\nL.E.S. testified that she would like for visitation to be one week with the\n\nfather and one week with the mother. L.E.S. testified that the mother is\n\n                                    16\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\na good mom but that she misses the father. She said that she loves her\n\nparents &quot;the same.&quot;\n\n     On January 4, 2024, the father filed a motion to consider a posttrial\n\nmaterial change of circumstances, alleging that the mother had\n\nremarried. On January 4, 2024, the mother filed a motion to strike the\n\nfather&#x27;s motion. On January 22, 2024, the father filed a response to the\n\nmotion to strike. On February 23, 2024, the mother filed an emergency\n\nmotion for an order directing the father to return A.B.S. The mother\n\nalleged that A.B.S. had left a school show-choir trip to go with the father\n\nand that the father had encouraged A.B.S. to disregard school policies\n\nand procedures. On February 26, 2024, the father filed a motion seeking\n\nan order directing the mother to return the father&#x27;s name to the children&#x27;s\n\nschools&#x27; &quot;check in/out lists for the minor children,&quot; which the trial court\n\nhad orally directed the mother to do during the trial. The father alleged\n\nthat the show choir had been on a trip to Mississippi; that the father had\n\nprovided the school with prior notice that he would pick up the child for\n\na visit to a Mississippi college; and that, because the mother had not\n\ncomplied with the oral directive of the trial court to return the father&#x27;s\n\nname to the children&#x27;s schools&#x27; permission-to-check-out lists, the child\n\n\n                                    17\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nhad been suspended from show choir.\n\n     On March 7, 2024, the mother filed a second emergency motion for\n\nthe immediate return of A.B.S. On March 8, 2024, the trial court entered\n\nthe following order:\n\n            &quot;Upon consideration of [the father&#x27;s] Motion to enter\n     Order Regarding School Check-In/Out, the Court finds that\n     the same is due to be granted. Further, the Court finds that\n     the situation regarding the child being removed from show\n     choir was the fault of [the mother] due to her failure or refusal\n     to follow this Court&#x27;s Order issued in open court in November\n     of 2023 that she add [the father] to the check-in/check-out list\n     at [the child&#x27;s] school. Accordingly, it is hereby,\n\n           &quot;ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\n\n           &quot;1. The [father&#x27;s] Motion is GRANTED.\n\n           &quot;2. If she has not done so already, [the mother] shall\n     immediately add [the father&#x27;s] name to the check-in/check-out\n     list at every school where a child of the parties is in\n     attendance. This Court hopes the oldest child&#x27;s school will\n     reconsider and not penalize the minor child by removing her\n     from show choir for an issue that should not have existed but\n     for [the mother&#x27;s] lack of following an Order of this Court.&quot;\n\n(Capitalization in original.)\n\n     On April 24, 2024, the mother filed a motion to set an in-person\n\nstatus hearing. On May 3, 2024, the mother filed a renewed motion to set\n\nan in-person status hearing. On May 10, 2024, the trial court entered an\n\norder setting all pending matters for a hearing on May 30, 2024. On June\n\n                                    18\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n20, 2024, the trial court denied the father&#x27;s motion to consider a posttrial\n\nmaterial change of circumstances. On July 17, 2024, the trial court\n\ndenied the mother&#x27;s motions for the immediate return of A.B.S.\n\n     On August 2, 2024, the trial court entered a final judgment,\n\nmodifying the father&#x27;s visitation schedule because the children, who were\n\nages 9, 7, 6, and 4 at the time of the divorce, were now ages 17, 15, 14,\n\nand 12. The trial court found that the visitation schedule needed to be\n\nmodified to reflect the current ages, activities and maturity levels of the\n\nchildren and because of the inability of the parents to agree on many\n\nsignificant matters. The trial court modified the father&#x27;s visitation\n\nschedule so that, during the school year, the father would have visitation\n\nwith the children every other weekend from Friday after school until\n\n&quot;Wednesday morning return to school.&quot;         As set out in the divorce\n\njudgment, the father would continue to have visitation with the children\n\novernight on Tuesday during those weeks when the father did not have\n\nweekend visitation. The trial court awarded the father an additional\n\nthree weeks of summer visitation so that each party had five weeks of\n\nsummer vacation with the children, and the trial court awarded the\n\nfather Christmas-vacation visitation from December 26 to the start of the\n\n\n                                    19\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nschool year in January.\n\n     The trial court vacated its earlier order regarding the children&#x27;s\n\npassports. The trial court found that any prior concerns of the mother\n\nthat the father would abscond with the children were not supported by\n\nany evidence, and it determined that, considering that the passports had\n\nbeen obtained through the efforts of the father and at his expense and\n\nthat the mother had not used the passports, the previous requirements\n\nregarding the father&#x27;s use of the passports had proven to be cumbersome\n\nand at times unworkable given the parties&#x27; inability to cooperate on such\n\nmatters.\n\n     The trial court&#x27;s judgment further provided as follows:\n\n           &quot;2. CHILD SUPPORT:\n\n           &quot;(a) Child support is currently set at $2,000.00 per\n     month. Evidence was presented through testimony and\n     documents that the father is earning a significantly larger\n     amount of money per year than when the parties entered into\n     the Divorce Agreement, an increase of much more than ten\n     percent. Furthermore, evidence was presented to show that\n     the children&#x27;s increased needs support a modification of child\n     support. The father&#x27;s income alone exceeds the upper limits of\n     the Child Support Guidelines calculations of $30,000.00 per\n     month, and the parties&#x27; combined monthly income exceeds\n     that amount by more than $10,000.00. As such, the Court\n     finds it is proper to set an amount of child support that\n     exceeds the Child Support Guidelines&#x27; uppermost dollar\n\n\n                                   20\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n    amounts, but not at the dollar amounts suggested by counsel\n    for the mother.\n\n          &quot;(b) Considering and allowing for other financial\n    considerations set out herein, the Court ORDERS that the\n    father shall pay the sum of $5,000.00 per month in child\n    support. retroactive to the first full month after the original\n    date of the filing of [the mother&#x27;s] Answer and Counterclaim\n    for Contempt and Modification of Child Support and Tax\n    Exemptions, which will be October of 2021 (date of filing was\n    September 16, 2021). This order and calculation thereon\n    ($3,000.00 for 34 months) establishes arrears of $102,000.00.\n    The [father] shall pay the arrears (added to the monthly child\n    support amount) in equal payments of $1,325.00 each month\n    for the next 77 months until the child support arrears are paid\n    off in December of 2030, which coincides with the month the\n    youngest child turns 19. The [father] shall make all child\n    support payments the first (1st) day of each month hereafter,\n    except that the payment for August of 2024 shall be due by\n    August 7, 2024.\n\n         &quot;(c) Monthly child support payments shall continue until\n    each child reaches the age of 19, shall marry, die or otherwise\n    become emancipated, consistent with the following\n    paragraph.\n\n          &quot;(d) The first month after the oldest child turns 19, the\n    monthly child support amount shall decrease to $4,300.00 per\n    month. The first month after the next oldest child turns 19,\n    the monthly child support amount shall decrease to $3,600.00\n    per month. The first month after the next oldest child turns\n    19, the monthly child support amount shall decrease to\n    $3,000.00 per month. The father&#x27;s child support obligations\n    shall terminate with the payment of the December 2030\n    payment.\n\n         &quot;(e) With input from the mother, the father shall\n    purchase dependable vehicles for his three youngest\n\n                                  21\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n    daughters upon each reaching the age of sixteen. The father\n    shall be responsible for the maintenance, insurance and\n    upkeep for any vehicle driven by his daughters through the\n    age of their majority, even if it means reimbursing the mother\n    for sums paid for those expenses.\n\n          &quot;3. All provisions of the Judgment and subsequent\n    orders not modified herein shall remain in full force and\n    effect.\n\n          &quot;4. [The mother] shall make it clear to Auburn City\n    Schools that [the father] has full authority to check the\n    children in or out of school.\n\n          &quot;5. The parties shall work together so that [the father]\n    has the requisite information so that he may register for\n    notifications from schools, extracurricular activities, and\n    medical providers.\n\n         &quot;….\n\n          &quot;7. Both parties are found in contempt for interfering\n    with visitation time, and violating both the letter and the\n    spirit of the Court&#x27;s prior Orders. Over the years, the Court\n    recalls that the parties have almost never been able to\n    voluntarily agree to adjust their situation to reflect the\n    growth and changing needs of their children and the changing\n    circumstances of each other. The parties have failed or\n    refused to enter into good faith negotiations to amicably\n    resolve matters and avoid having to litigate in court; and\n    stubborn, selfish and contemptuous behavior by one or both\n    parties has inevitably led to the filing of claims and counter-\n    claims, Rule Nisi and contempt actions. Sadly, this behavior\n    has, in the Court&#x27;s opinion, resulted in the children beginning\n    to take sides and not only using one parent against the other,\n    but also using one or more siblings against the other(s) and a\n    parent. Since this Court&#x27;s last award of attorney fees against\n    the father, the Court has been unable to keep a running score,\n\n                                  22\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     so to speak, and is unable to determine which party is the\n     most in contempt. As such, the Court here declines to award\n     either party attorney fees or costs for the contempts of the\n     other.\n\n          &quot;8. Neither party shall schedule a medical or counseling\n     appointment for a child during the custodial time of the other,\n     except by agreement or absolute medical necessity.\n\n            &quot;9. Each parent is to enforce in his or her home the\n     discipline imposed by the other in her or his home, especially\n     as it relates to the types of discipline universally known to be\n     most effective, such as the deprivation of driving privileges,\n     dispossession of phones and/or electronic devices, and periods\n     of being grounded in the home. Enforcing the dispossession of\n     phones or electronic devices does not encompass prohibiting\n     the child from using the parent&#x27;s phone to maintain minimal\n     but routine contact with the other parent.\n\n          &quot;10. Neither party may block the other party on a child&#x27;s\n     phone, nor disable location services on a child&#x27;s phone.\n\n           &quot;11. The mother shall timely inform the father of any\n     medical, academic or religious issues concerning the children,\n     and inform the father of sports or other extracurricular\n     activities involving the children which she may have reason\n     to believe he is unaware.\n\n           &quot;12. The father shall not travel to the mother&#x27;s home for\n     any reason other than to facilitate an exchange of the\n     children, unless approved or requested by the mother.\n\n          &quot;13. Any other relief requested by either party, not\n     addressed herein, is hereby DENIED.&quot;\n\n(Capitalization in original.)\n\n     On August 28, 2024, the father filed a motion to alter, amend, or\n\n                                   23\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nvacate the judgment, arguing that the evidence presented supported a\n\ncustody modification awarding the parties&#x27; joint legal and physical\n\ncustody; that the modification of child support was not supported by the\n\nevidence; that the trial court had erred in awarding retroactive child\n\nsupport; and that the trial court had erred in ordering the father to\n\npurchase automobiles for the children.      On September 2, 2024, the\n\nmother filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment, arguing,\n\namong other things, that the trial court had exceeded its discretion to\n\nessentially &quot;back door&quot; or &quot;work around&quot; Ex parte McLendon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1719358\"><a href=\"/opinion/1719358/ex-parte-mclendon/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Ex Parte McLendon\">455 So. 2d\n\n863</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ala. 1984), by substantially modifying the father&#x27;s physical time\n\nwith the children to almost equal physical time even though the father\n\ndid not meet the necessary burden of proof under the McLendon\n\nstandard. In addition, the mother argued that the visitation modification\n\ndid not take into consideration the testimony of two of the four children,\n\nwho each expressed a preference for maintaining the existing visitation\n\nschedule that had been in place for the past eight years.\n\n     On October 28, 2024, the father filed a motion to clarify regarding\n\nthe renewal of the children&#x27;s passports.

The father argues\n\n                                      25\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nthat the trial court essentially agreed that there had been a material\n\nchange in circumstances because the trial court substantially increased\n\nthe father&#x27;s visitation. The father argues that his visitation schedule is\n\nclose to joint physical custody because, while the children are in school,\n\nthe father has the children six nights of each two-week period and, during\n\nthe remainder of the year, physical custody is approximately divided\n\nequally between the parties. The father argues that the mother had not\n\nfollowed the terms of the divorce judgment, that the mother had\n\nconsistently interfered with the father&#x27;s visitation rights, that the mother\n\nhad disparaged the father to other parents to the detriment of the\n\nchildren, and that all four children had acknowledged that it was difficult\n\nto go back and forth between the parents for a day or an evening. The\n\nfather argues that a joint-physical-custody arrangement would have\n\nlittle disruptive effect because the children would attend the same\n\nschools and church at either parent&#x27;s residence.\n\n           &quot;In reviewing judgments involving determinations of\n     child custody, &#x27;the trial court is in the better position to\n     consider all of the evidence, as well as the many inferences\n     that may be drawn from that evidence, and to decide the issue\n     of custody.&#x27; Ex parte Bryowsky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1720439\"><a href=\"/opinion/1720439/ex-parte-bryowsky/#1326\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Ex Parte Bryowsky\">676 So. 2d 1322, 1326</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ala.\n     1996). &#x27;[A]ppellate review of a judgment modifying custody\n     when the evidence was presented ore tenus is limited to\n     determining whether there was sufficient evidence to support\n\n                                    26\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\n     the trial court&#x27;s judgment.&#x27; Cheek v.

The\n\nfather&#x27;s primary argument for the modification was that joint physical\n\ncustody would be convenient for the children.

At best, the trial court\n     was made aware of the parties&#x27; respective incomes at the time\n     of the divorce, [the father] was employed and earning\n     approximately $122,000.00 per year, and [the mother] was not\n     employed outside of the home. … No testimony or other\n     evidence was presented concerning the lifestyle to which the\n     children were accustomed and the standard of living enjoyed\n     before the parties were divorced.\n\n           &quot;[The mother] presented no testimony or other evidence,\n     certainly not substantial evidence, of the reasonable and\n     necessary needs of the children, an increase in those needs, or\n     an increase in the reasonable and necessary expenses of the\n     minor children.

The trial court&#x27;s finding that &#x27;the costs of raising\n     the children have increased,&#x27; … appears to be more of a\n     general statement, as no such evidence was presented.\n\n           &quot;The one item that [the mother] might suggest could be\n     evidence in support of her request was the allegation of the\n     children&#x27;s monthly activity expense being $1,195.00 per\n     month; however, on cross examination, [the mother] provided\n     no support for the alleged expenses. … Even if the allegation\n     of a monthly activity expense of $1,195.00 was supported by\n     substantial evidence, and it is not, no evidence was presented\n     to suggest that the monthly activity expense had increased.\n     ____________________\n\n          &quot;8More specifically, the increase in [the father&#x27;s] income.\n     [The mother] all but ignored the increase in her own income.\n     The trial court also ignored the increase in [the mother&#x27;s]\n     income….&quot;\n\nThe father&#x27;s brief at 36-38.

Nevertheless, in\n    considering the issue of child support, the trial court could\n    consider the lifestyle to which the children were accustomed,\n    see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1641326\"><a href=\"/opinion/1641326/brasfield-v-brasfield/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Brasfield v.

However, the record contains no discussion of\n    where the wife and children might reside after they moved\n    from the marital residence and contains little discussion of\n    the specific needs of the children or the costs associated with\n    their care beyond the son&#x27;s day-care expense of $1,200 per\n    month, which was scheduled to end in the fall of 2020 when\n    he began kindergarten, statements that spending for the\n    children&#x27;s clothes was a few hundred dollars every few\n    months, and a discussion of certain past-due amounts that\n    were not discussed in terms of monthly costs. As noted, the\n    husband was otherwise responsible for one-half of the\n    children&#x27;s extracurricular-activity expenses and for the\n    payment of the children&#x27;s health insurance, which was $550\n    per month, and the costs of the daughter&#x27;s counseling, for\n    which no evidence of cost was presented. Thus, those expenses\n    may not be considered as part of the children&#x27;s expenses\n    included within the $7,050 child-support award.

Those expenses included a 4/5 portion of the mother&#x27;s monthly\n\nexpenses for automobile insurance, gasoline, utilities, pest control, a\n\nhousekeeper,     homeowner&#x27;s     association    fees,    the    children&#x27;s\n\nextracurricular activities, groceries, her saving for the purchase of\n\nautomobiles, her mortgage payment, house maintenance, vacation\n\nexpenses, entertainment, clothing, haircuts, and other incidentals. The\n\nmother included all of the oldest child&#x27;s car-insurance and gasoline\n\nexpenses.   The mother also included all the counseling fees for the\n\nchildren along with the cost of their prescription medications as part of\n\nher monthly expenses.\n\n     We are unable to discern how the trial court determined the amount\n\nof the increase in child support or come to the conclusion that the father\n\n\n                                   35\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nshould be required to purchase cars along with paying for car-related\n\nexpenses. First, not all of the mother&#x27;s claimed monthly expenses appear\n\nto be supported by the record. For example, the mother claimed that the\n\nchildren had expenses of $1,195 a month for extracurricular activities.\n\nWhen asked about the expenses, the mother stated that show-choir cost\n\n$2,000 a year, that soccer cost $1,000 a year, that volleyball cost $600 a\n\nyear, and that piano lessons cost $90 a month, which amounts to $390\n\nper month ($2,000 divided by 12 is $167; $1,000 divided by 12 is $83; and\n\n$600 divided by 12 is $50).   Also, the mother included certain medical\n\nexpenses as her expenses, but she admitted 80% of those expenses were\n\nto be reimbursed by the father under the divorce judgment. It does not\n\nappear that the trial court considered that the father, while paying\n\n$2,000 a month in child support, had also paid an additional $250 per\n\nmonth for the children&#x27;s activities since the parties divorced in 2016.\n\nSecond, it appears that some of the expenses the mother claimed in her\n\nchild-support request regarding automobiles for the children duplicate\n\nthe trial court&#x27;s mandate that the father purchase, maintain, and insure\n\ncars for the children. Therefore, we reverse the portion of the judgment\n\nsetting an amount of child support and requiring the father to purchase\n\n\n                                   36\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nautomobiles and pay car-related expenses for the entry of a judgment\n\nthat will allow this court to determine whether the trial court&#x27;s award\n\nprovides for the reasonable and necessary needs of the children.\n\n                       Retroactive Child Support\n\n     The father argues that the trial court erred in awarding the mother\n\nretroactive child support because, he says, (1) the mother did not request\n\nretroactive support, (2) the father had provided support pursuant to the\n\nparties&#x27; agreement incorporated into the 2016 divorce judgment, (3) the\n\nmother presented no evidence concerning the children&#x27;s needs or\n\nexpenses during the period for which the retroactive child support was\n\nawarded, and (4) the mother did not present evidence indicating that the\n\nchildren were not &quot;provided for&quot; during the period for which the\n\nretroactive child support was awarded.\n\n     In Brown v.

Although the trial court\n\nhad never entered a pendente lite child-support order in the case, it was\n\nundisputed that the husband had voluntarily paid $100 per week in child\n\nsupport during the first year after the parties separated in June 1995.\n\n\n                                   37\n\fCL-2024-0992\n\nThe husband paid no child support from June 1996 until the divorce\n\njudgment was entered in July 1997. The husband argued that the trial\n\ncourt had erred in awarding the wife a $7,500 &quot;arrearage&quot; in child\n\nsupport for the period of June 1996 to July 1997 when the trial court had\n\nnever entered a pendente lite child-support order. The husband also\n\nargued that the arrearage award was arbitrary and without support in\n\nthe record. This court disagreed, writing:\n\n           &quot;In cases seeking modification of child support, it is\n     within the discretion of the trial court to make any\n     modification retroactive to the date of the filing of the petition\n     for the modification.

Finally, the Alabama legislature recognized the\n     parent&#x27;s duty to support a child and created a cause of action\n     for retroactive support. See §§ 30-3-110 et seq., Ala.

In future cases, when awarding retroactive\n     support, the trial court should state its reasons for the award,\n     the factors it considered, and the manner in which it\n     calculated the retroactive support award.\n\n          &quot;We emphasize that this holding is not meant to\n     eliminate the use of pendente lite orders for temporary child\n     support during the pendency of divorce proceedings.

By extension, Matter\nof A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014), and any decision issued in reliance thereupon\nis also overruled.\n\n                  BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n    Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1)(i), I direct the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (“Board”) to refer this case to me for my review. With the case thus\nreferred, I hereby remand to the Board for further consideration consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n    Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), the Attorney\nGeneral may grant asylum to individuals who meet several statutory\nrequirements, including an inability to return to their home country because\nof “persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race,\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\nopinion.” INA § 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see INA\n§ 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). In Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec.\n316 (A.G. 2018) (“A-B- I”), Attorney General Sessions clarified the\nstandards that an asylum applicant must meet to establish persecution on\naccount of membership in a “particular social group.” Id. at 317. If the\nalleged persecutor is unaffiliated with the government of the applicant’s\nhome country, Attorney General Sessions further ruled, then “the applicant\nmust show that flight from her country is necessary because her home\ngovernment is unwilling or unable to protect her.” Id. In Matter of A-B-,\n28 I&N Dec. 199 (A.G. 2021) (“A-B- II”), Acting Attorney General\nRosen further clarified that standard. In Matter of A-B-, 28 I&N\nDec. 307 (A.G. 2021) (“A-B- III”), however, Attorney General Garland\nvacated both A-B- I and A-B- II in anticipation of a rulemaking\ndirected by President Biden. See Exec. Order No. 14010, § 4(c)(ii),\n86 Fed. Reg. 8267, 8271 (Feb. 2, 2021). Attorney General Garland\ninstructed “immigration judges and the Board [to] follow pre-A-B-I\nprecedent” until the completion of that anticipated rulemaking, and\nparticularly Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014), which A-B- I\n\n                                         Page\n                                         207\n\fCite as 29 I&N Dec. 207 (A.G. 2025)                      Interim Decision #4123\n\n\n\n\nhad overruled. A-B- III, 28 I&N Dec. at 309. That anticipated rulemaking\nnever occurred.\n\n    Respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, applied for asylum\nclaiming she would be persecuted in Honduras on account of her political\nopinions and membership in several purported particular social groups,\nincluding “Honduran women,” “Honduran women unable to leave a\nrelationship,” “Honduran women who have demonstrated resistance to\nHonduran society’s acceptance of male domination,” and “Honduran women\nwith views of women’s autonomy.” Matter of S-S-F-M-, at 1 (BIA Oct. 20,\n2023) (unpublished decision). Respondent also claimed that the Honduran\ngovernment was “unable or unwilling” to control her alleged abuser. Id. at 3.\nThe Immigration Judge (“IJ”) rejected those claims in part relying on A-B- I\n(which had not yet been vacated) and denied respondent’s application for\nasylum and withholding of removal. Id. at 1–2, 2 n.4. The Board affirmed\nthe IJ’s decision but declined to rely on A-B- I, noting that the decision had\nbeen vacated by A-B- III. Id. Respondent filed a petition for review in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which granted the\nparties’ joint motion for remand to allow the Board to reconsider several\nissues in respondent’s appeal, many of which may be implicated by the legal\nstandards articulated in A-B- I and A-B- II. S-S-F-M- v. Garland,\nNo. 23-60586 (5th Cir. Mar. 18, 2024) (unpublished order).\n\n    Having considered the case following remand from the Fifth Circuit, I\nconclude A-B- III was incorrect. I hereby reinstitute the legal standards\narticulated in A-B- I and A-B- II, and overrule A-B- III (and, by extension,\nMatter of A-R-C-G- and any decision issued in reliance thereupon).\nFurthermore, I remand this matter to the Board for adjudication in light of\nthe standards articulated in A-B- I and A-B- II.\n\n    In my view, A-B- I’s analysis and articulation of the standards for\ndeciding asylum applications reflect the “best reading” of the statutory text\n“applying all relevant interpretive tools.” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo,\n603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024). A-B- III never stated otherwise. Instead, A-B- III\nabandoned the rules established in A-B- I and A-B- II in deference to an\nanticipated executive rulemaking that never occurred. But the reasons\nA-B- III gave for doing so are unpersuasive.\n\n   First, A-B- III noted that A-B- I contains “broad language” that “could be\nread to create a strong presumption against asylum claims based on private\nconduct.” 28 I&N Dec. at 309. But A-B- I used that language for good\nreason: It has long been well-established that “[p]ersecution is something a\ngovernment does,” Hor v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 482, 485 (7th Cir. 2005), and\n                                      page\n                                      208\n\fCite as 29 I&N Dec. 207 (A.G. 2025)                       Interim Decision #4123\n\n\n\n\nso must be “inflicted either by the government of a country or by persons or\nan organization that the government was unable or unwilling to control.”\nMatter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985); see also Galina v. INS,\n213 F.3d 955, 958 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that an applicant must show\nthat the government condoned private actions “or at least demonstrated a\ncomplete helplessness to protect the victims”). Although there may be\ncircumstances when a government’s failure to control private conduct itself\namounts to persecution, A-B- I was entirely correct to treat those\ncircumstances as few and far between.\n\n    Second, A-B- III insisted that A-B- I “spawned confusion among courts”\nbecause one court of appeals found that A-B- I announced a “new, more\ndemanding standard” for determining when private conduct can amount to\npublic persecution than the traditional “unable or unwilling” standard.\n28 I&N Dec. at 309 (quoting Grace v. Barr, 965 F.3d 883, 898 (D.C. Cir.\n2020)). But as the Third Circuit subsequently explained, the only court of\nappeals to express such confusion—the D.C. Circuit—failed to “account for”\nthe full relevant test, “isolate[d] the standards from their surrounding words,”\nand “overlook[ed] the relationships” those words described.\nGaleas Figueroa v. Att’y Gen. United States, 998 F.3d 77, 91 (3d Cir. 2021).\nA-B- II, moreover, explained that A-B- I “reiterated and did not change the\nlegal standard for determining when ‘persecution’ by third parties may be\nattributed to the government.” See 28 I&N Dec. at 213; see also id. at 202\n(“No matter whether Matter of A-B- is viewed as changing the existing\nstandard for persecution, I conclude . . . that Matter of A-B-’s formulation\nappropriately clarifies the requisite governmental role in relation to\npersecution by private actors for purposes of establishing refugee status.”).\nA-B- II then clarified the application of that standard. See id. at 203–07. If\nanything, it is Attorney General Garland’s decision to vacate that\nclarification without replacing it with anything himself that has contributed\nto confusion over the applicable standards in this field.\n\n    Third, A-B- III was wrong to suggest that the issues addressed in A-B- I\nand A-B- II are best left to rulemaking. “[W]hether A-B- I had changed the\n‘unable or unwilling’ standard, the proper application of that standard, and\nthe meaning of the statutory ‘one central reason’ test,” A-B- III, 28 I&N Dec.\nat 309, are legal questions appropriately resolved as part of the Attorney\nGeneral’s authority to issue “controlling” decisions “with respect to all\nquestions of law” “relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens,”\n8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). And as Attorney General Barr explained in a different\nopinion that I am reinstituting as precedent today, what constitutes a\ncognizable social group is “defined with sufficient particularity and is\nsocially distinct in [an applicant’s] society” is inherently a “fact-based\n                                      page\n                                      209\n\fCite as 29 I&N Dec. 207 (A.G. 2025)                     Interim Decision #4123\n\n\n\n\ninquiry.” Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 581, 586 (A.G. 2019). That such\nan inquiry is better resolved through case-by-case adjudication than\nbroad-based rulemaking is confirmed by the failure of the previous\nadministration to issue any rule addressing the meaning of “particular social\ngroup” over almost three years—despite a (now rescinded) Executive Order\nrequiring that the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General do\nso “within 270 days.” Exec. Order No. 14010, § 4(c)(ii), 86 Fed. Reg. at\n8271; see Exec. Order No. 14148, § 2(u), 90 Fed. Reg. 8237, 8238 (Jan. 20,\n2025) (rescinding Executive Order 14010). Accordingly, I hereby instruct\nthat immigration judges and the Board shall adhere to A-B- I and A-B- II in\nall pending or future cases, and disregard A-B- III. I remand this matter to\nthe Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and with the\nopinions in A-B- I and A-B- II.\n\n\n\n\n                                      page\n                                      210\n\f",

Id. at 1–2, 2 n.4. The Board affirmed\nthe IJ’s decision but declined to rely on A-B- I, noting that the decision had\nbeen vacated by A-B- III. Id. Respondent filed a petition for review in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which granted the\nparties’ joint motion for remand to allow the Board to reconsider several\nissues in respondent’s appeal, many of which may be implicated by the legal\nstandards articulated in A-B- I and A-B- II. S-S-F-M- v. Garland,\nNo. 23-60586 (5th Cir. Mar. 18, 2024) (unpublished order).\n\n    Having considered the case following remand from the Fifth Circuit, I\nconclude A-B- III was incorrect. I hereby reinstitute the legal standards\narticulated in A-B- I and A-B- II, and overrule A-B- III (and, by extension,\nMatter of A-R-C-G- and any decision issued in reliance thereupon).\nFurthermore, I remand this matter to the Board for adjudication in light of\nthe standards articulated in A-B- I and A-B- II.\n\n    In my view, A-B- I’s analysis and articulation of the standards for\ndeciding asylum applications reflect the “best reading” of the statutory text\n“applying all relevant interpretive tools.” Loper Bright Enters. v.

Instead, A-B- III\nabandoned the rules established in A-B- I and A-B- II in deference to an\nanticipated executive rulemaking that never occurred. But the reasons\nA-B- III gave for doing so are unpersuasive.\n\n   First, A-B- III noted that A-B- I contains “broad language” that “could be\nread to create a strong presumption against asylum claims based on private\nconduct.” 28 I&amp;N Dec. at 309.

Although there may be\ncircumstances when a government’s failure to control private conduct itself\namounts to persecution, A-B- I was entirely correct to treat those\ncircumstances as few and far between.\n\n    Second, A-B- III insisted that A-B- I “spawned confusion among courts”\nbecause one court of appeals found that A-B- I announced a “new, more\ndemanding standard” for determining when private conduct can amount to\npublic persecution than the traditional “unable or unwilling” standard.\n28 I&amp;N Dec. at 309 (quoting Grace v. Barr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">965 F.3d 883</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898 (D.C. Cir.\n2020)). But as the Third Circuit subsequently explained, the only court of\nappeals to express such confusion—the D.C. Circuit—failed to “account for”\nthe full relevant test, “isolate[d] the standards from their surrounding words,”\nand “overlook[ed] the relationships” those words described.\nGaleas Figueroa v. Att’y Gen. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">998 F.3d 77</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (3d Cir. 2021).\nA-B- II, moreover, explained that A-B- I “reiterated and did not change the\nlegal standard for determining when ‘persecution’ by third parties may be\nattributed to the government.” See 28 I&amp;N Dec. at 213; see also id. at 202\n(“No matter whether Matter of A-B- is viewed as changing the existing\nstandard for persecution, I conclude . . . that Matter of A-B-’s formulation\nappropriately clarifies the requisite governmental role in relation to\npersecution by private actors for purposes of establishing refugee status.”).\nA-B- II then clarified the application of that standard. See id. at 203–07. If\nanything, it is Attorney General Garland’s decision to vacate that\nclarification without replacing it with anything himself that has contributed\nto confusion over the applicable standards in this field.\n\n    Third, A-B- III was wrong to suggest that the issues addressed in A-B- I\nand A-B- II are best left to rulemaking. “[W]hether A-B- I had changed the\n‘unable or unwilling’ standard, the proper application of that standard, and\nthe meaning of the statutory ‘one central reason’ test,” A-B- III, 28 I&amp;N Dec.\nat 309, are legal questions appropriately resolved as part of the Attorney\nGeneral’s authority to issue “controlling” decisions “with respect to all\nquestions of law” “relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens,”\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U.S.C. § 1103</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1).

For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n          {¶ 2} On April 14, 2023, appellee filed a DVCPO against appellant. That same day,\nthe trial court granted appellee’s ex parte temporary DVCPO against appellant and set the\nmatter for a full hearing. On April 24, 2023, the trial court continued the scheduled full\nhearing because appellant had not yet been served with the petition and notice of the\nhearing. (May 1, 2023 Order & Entry.) On May 25, 2023, the trial court continued the full\nhearing a second time citing other good cause, to wit: “ongoing trial.” (May 25, 2023 Order\n& Entry.) On September 15, 2023, the trial court continued the full hearing a third time\n\n\n1 Appellee did not file a brief in this case.\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                 2\n\n\nbased on “an ongoing 30+ day trial.” (Capitalization omitted.) (Sept. 20, 2023 Order &\nEntry.) The full hearing was ultimately held on October 26 and October 27, 2023. Upon\nthe completion of the full hearing, the trial court granted the DVCPO against appellant on\nNovember 1, 2023.\n       {¶ 3} Appellant filed a timely appeal.\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n       {¶ 4} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n              [I.] Appellant, having been served with a protection order, was\n              directed to attend court on May 25th, 2023. On the designated\n              date and time, Appellant diligently appeared, only to be\n              unjustly denied the opportunity to address the accusations and\n              alleviate the court’s concerns. Furthermore, Appellant was\n              wrongly deprived of the right to present their case or engage\n              with the appointed judge regarding the matter.\n\n              [II.] Appellant’s entitlement to have their case heard and\n              adjudicated within 30 days, as mandated by Ohio Revised Code\n              3113.31, was unjustly denied. The prescribed procedure was not\n              adhere to, resulting in a violation of Appellant’s rights.\n\n              [III.] Despite the Appellant issuing nearly 30 subpoenas, the\n              court failed to summon all available individuals, neglecting to\n              assess their knowledge of the case or determine the materiality\n              of their testimony to the Appellant’s case.\n\n              [IV.] The Appellant, having obtained evidence pertaining to the\n              mental stability of the Appellee, was unjustly denied the right\n              to present this crucial evidence. In contrast, during opening\n              statements, the Appellee was permitted to speak unchecked for\n              over twenty minutes, delving into matters unrelated to the\n              complaint. However, when it came time to present evidence,\n              the Appellant was unduly restricted being informed that only\n              evidence directly correlating to the Appellee’s written\n              statements would be admissible.\n\nIII. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n       A. Appellant’s First and Second Assignments of Error\n       {¶ 5} In appellant’s first assignment of error, he alleges that the trial court deprived\nhim of his right to present his case at the May 25, 2023 hearing. In appellant’s second\nassignment of error, he alleges that the trial court erred by failing to hold a full hearing\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                              3\n\n\nwithin the statutory requirements of R.C. 3113.31. Because these assignments of error are\nintertwined, we will address them together.\n       {¶ 6} Pursuant to R.C. 3113.31, a petitioner may seek a DVCPO to enjoin the\nrespondent from further violence against the family or household members. Parrish v.\nParrish, 95 Ohio St.3d 1201, 1204, 2002-Ohio-1623. If a petitioner requests an ex parte\norder, the trial court must hold a hearing that same day. R.C. 3113.31(D)(1). At the\nconclusion of an ex parte hearing, the trial court, for “good cause shown,” may issue a\ntemporary order at petitioner’s request. R.C. 3113.31(D)(1). If an ex parte DVCPO is put in\nplace, due process and statutory requirements mandate that the trial court “schedule a full\nhearing” within seven court days and provide respondent “notice of, and an opportunity to\nbe heard at, the full hearing.” R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a). However, the trial court “may” grant\na continuance of the full hearing to a reasonable time determined by the court when: (1)\nrespondent has not been served with the petition and notice prior to the date of hearing;\n(2) the parties have consented to a continuance; (3) a continuance is necessary to allow a\nparty to obtain counsel; or (4) the continuance is warranted for other good cause. R.C.\n3113.31(D)(2)(a)(i) through (iv).\n       {¶ 7} While questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law that we\nreview de novo, see, e.g., State v. Taylor, 163 Ohio St.3d 508, 2020-Ohio-6786, ¶ 15, citing\nState v. Consilio, 114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, ¶ 8, a trial court’s determination\nwhether to grant or deny a motion to continue is reviewed under an abuse of discretion\nanalysis. S.D. v. S.L, 6th Dist. No. WD-23-006, 2023-Ohio-4575, ¶ 14, citing R.H. v. J.H.,\n9th Dist. No. 18CA0115-M, 2020-Ohio-3402, ¶ 6, citing State v. Unger, 67 Ohio St.2d 65\n(1981).   An abuse of discretion connotes that the trial court’s determination was\nunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217,\n219 (1983). As appellate courts have long noted that when vesting the trial court with\ndiscretionary determinations, it is inevitable two trial court judges could have different\nconclusions on what constitutes “good cause.” Diverging discretionary determinations,\nhowever, do not necessarily mean that either decision amounts to an abuse of discretion.\nWaterford Tower Condominium Assn. v. TransAmerica Real Estate Group., 10th Dist. No.\n05AP-593, 2006-Ohio-508, ¶ 19 (concluding that different discretionary determinations by\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                  4\n\n\ntrial court judges “does not compel the finding that either judge committed an abuse of\ndiscretion”).\n       {¶ 8} Appellant first claims that the trial court failed to hold a hearing within the\nrequisite statutory period. R.C. 3113.31 directs that a full hearing must be scheduled within\nseven court days of the ex parte hearing. Upon review, we find that the trial court complied\nwith this statutory directive as the April 24, 2023 full hearing was scheduled within seven\ncourt days of the April 14, 2023 ex parte hearing. The next question is whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by granting multiple continuances prior to the October 26, 2023\nhearing.\n       {¶ 9} Preliminarily, we must resolve whether appellant waived his right to contest\nthe grounds for the various continuances of the full hearing. On September 15, 2023, the\ntrial court continued the full hearing until October 26, 2023 based on an “ongoing 30+ day\ntrial.” (Capitalization omitted.) (Sept. 20, 2023 Order & Entry.) The parties, including\nappellant, signed the September 20 order and continuance entry, which noted “[e]ach party\nwaives the requirement for this matter to be concluded within thirty (30) days.” (Sept. 20,\n2023 Order & Entry.) Similarly, after the parties were not able to complete the full hearing\non October 26, 2023, the trial court continued the case to resume the following day. The\nparties signed a final continuance entry that acknowledged they waived the requirement\nthat this matter be concluded within 30 days. (Nov. 2, 2023 Order & Entry.) Furthermore,\nappellant failed to raise this issue with the trial court at any point during the full hearing.\n“It is axiomatic that a litigant’s failure to raise an issue at the trial court level waives the\nlitigant’s right to raise that issue on appeal.” S.H. v. S.P., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-70, 2013-\nOhio-3833, ¶ 22, citing Shover v. Cordis Corp., 61 Ohio St.3d 213, 220 (1991), overruled on\nother grounds in Collins v. Sotka, 81 Ohio St.3d 506 (1998). Thus, appellant has waived\nthe issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion by continuing the full hearing.\n       {¶ 10} Arguendo, even if the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion\nby continuing the full hearing was preserved, we still find appellant’s second assignment of\nerror unavailing.      As set forth previously, R.C. 3113.31(D)(2) provides specific\ncircumstances that permit the trial court to grant a continuance. We will address each\ncontinuance and the cited justification in turn.\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                5\n\n\n       {¶ 11} The trial court first continued the April 24, 2023 full hearing as appellant had\nnot yet been served with the petition and notice of the full hearing. (May 1, 2023 Order &\nEntry.) R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a)(i) expressly permits the trial court to continue the hearing\nfor this exact reason. The trial court continued the full hearing on two more occasions\nbecause of ongoing trials. “[A] court has supervisory control over its own docket and has\nthe inherent authority to manage its own proceedings and grant continuances.” R.J.L. v.\nK.R., 8th Dist. No. 108228, 2019-Ohio-3667, ¶ 19, citing State ex rel. Buck v. McCabe, 140\nOhio St. 535, 537 (1942) (finding the trial court did not abuse its discretion by continuing a\nfull hearing based on its “congested trial schedule”).        We find that the trial court’s\ncontinuances based on other ongoing trials were reasonable as they would fall under the\ncategory of “other good cause.” R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a)(iv). The final continuance order was\nfiled as the trial court needed an additional day to conclude the full hearing. Because of the\nnumber of witnesses that were subpoenaed by the parties, it is reasonable to conclude that\nthe matter required an additional day of testimony. Moreover, appellant suffered no\nprejudice from the various continuances. With the additional time, appellant was able to\nfamiliarize himself with the petition and issue numerous subpoenas to witnesses to appear\nat the full hearing.    Appellant acknowledges as much in his brief stating that the\ncontinuance “puzzled me, as it seemingly benefited me at the request of my accuser.”\n(Appellant’s Brief at 6.)\n       {¶ 12} For the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant waived the statutory\nrequirements as evidenced by his signature on the two continuance entries and failure to\nraise the issue prior to the full hearing. Alternatively, we do not find that the trial court\nabused its discretion by continuing the full hearing as the cited justifications for the\ncontinuances fall under the statute’s available exceptions.\n       {¶ 13} Appellant next claims that he was denied his right to be present during the\nMay 25, 2023 hearing. Appellant argues that he never signed the May 25, 2023 order and\nentry and did not consent to the continuance. Appellant contends that he appeared for the\nMay 25 hearing only to be informed that the matter was continued.\n       {¶ 14} The record indicates that appellee filed her ex parte order on April 14, 2023\nand the original full hearing was scheduled for April 24, 2023. The trial court continued\nthe April 24, 2023 hearing until May 25, 2023 due to the lack of service of the petition and\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                  6\n\n\nnotice on appellant. (May 1, 2023 Order & Entry.) While appellant was apparently served\nwith “the ex parte/petition continuance” on May 23, 2023, the order was not filed with the\ntrial court until May 26, 2023. (Capitalization omitted.) (May 26, 2023 Order to Serve.)\nAccordingly, we can reasonably infer that the court was not aware of service on appellant\nuntil after the May 25, 2023 hearing was continued. While appellant claims that he\n“arriv[ed] [at the courthouse] early with the order in hand,” we do not have a transcript of\nthe May 25, 2023 proceedings to verify this claim. (Appellant’s Brief at 6.) Given the lack\nof a transcript, we presume the regularity of trial court’s proceeding as documented in the\ncourt’s May 25, 2023 entry. State ex rel. Bardwell v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., 127\nOhio St.3d 2020, 2010-Ohio-5073, ¶ 14, citing State ex rel. Hoag v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of\nElections, 125 Ohio St.3d 49, 2010-Ohio-1629, ¶ 12, citing Christy v. Summit Cty. Bd. of\nElections, 77 Ohio St.3d 35, 39 (1996). We also note that there is also some evidence that\nappellant was in fact out of the country at the time of the May 25, 2023 hearing. During the\nfull hearing, appellant testified that “[he] did not get back from Morocco until May 28th.”\n(Oct. 27, 2023 Tr. at 200.) Based on the date that the notice of service was filed with the\ntrial court, as well as appellant’s statement that he was out of the country on May 25, 2023,\nwe find appellant’s first assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶ 15} Appellant’s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n       B. Appellant’s Third and Fourth Assignments of Error\n       {¶ 16} In appellant’s third assignment of error, he contends that the trial court failed\nto summon all available individuals to testify at the full hearing. Similarly, appellant’s final\nassignment of error argues the trial court erred by not allowing him to question appellee as\nto her mental stability but allowed appellee to testify on matters unrelated to the complaint\nwithout objection. As these assignments of error are interrelated, we will address them\ntogether.\n       {¶ 17} The heart of appellant’s contention is that he was deprived of the ability to\npresent his case during the hearing. Stated another way, appellant contends he was denied\na “full hearing” under the statute. In cases where an appeal requires an analysis of R.C.\n3113.31, we apply a de novo standard of review. D.M.W. v. E.W., 10th Dist. No. 17AP-359,\n2018-Ohio-821, ¶ 11, citing Hope Academy Broadway Campus v. Ohio Dept. of Edn., 10th\nDist. No. 07AP-758, 2008-Ohio-4694, ¶ 13.\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                 7\n\n\n       {¶ 18} While R.C. 3113.31 requires a “full hearing,” the statute does not define the\nterm “full hearing.” Generally, a “full hearing” “is one in which ample opportunity is\nafforded to all parties to make, by evidence and argument, a showing fairly adequate to\nestablish the propriety or impropriety of the step asked to be taken.” (Internal citation\nomitted.) Tarini v. Tarini, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-336, 2012-Ohio-6165, ¶ 14 (finding the\ndeprivation of a “full hearing” as contemplated by R.C. 3113.31 constitutes not only a\nviolation of the statute but a deprivation of due process). In cases where a protection order\nis contested, the trial court must “allow for presentation of evidence, both direct and\nrebuttal, as well as arguments.” Id. However, the trial court is by no means required to\nallow every piece of evidence offered by the parties. The trial court is vested with the\ndiscretion to admit or exclude relevant evidence. State v. Parker, 10th Dist. No. 20AP-527,\n2021-Ohio-3422, ¶ 11, citing State v. Robb, 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 69 (2000), citing State v.\nSage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. “ ‘Absent an abuse of\ndiscretion, as well as a showing that the accused has suffered material prejudice, an\nappellate court will not disturb the ruling of the trial court as to the admissibility of\nevidence.’ ” Parker at ¶ 11, quoting State v. Oteng, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-466, 2015-Ohio-\n1231, ¶ 31.\n       {¶ 19} Appellant first argues that the trial court improperly restricted his witnesses\nto those that were “directly relevant to the accusation.” (Appellant’s Brief at 6.) Upon\nreview of the hearing transcript, the trial court patiently waded through the many witnesses\nthat appeared, in person and over Zoom, in compliance with the subpoenas issued by the\nparties. The trial court worked with the parties, both pro se litigations, to determine if each\nwitness had relevant information to provide as to the allegations in appellee’s affidavit.\n       {¶ 20} At the start of the hearing, the trial court informed the parties that it was\ngoing to first inquire of each witness their name, relationship to the parties, and\ninformation they may have in the case. (Oct. 26, 2023 Tr. at 4.) The trial court noted that\nthe case is limited to the events in the allegation, and he would dismiss witnesses that were\nnot relevant to the claims at issue. During the initial vetting of the subpoenaed individuals,\nthe parties conferred with the trial court whether they believed a particular witness was\nrelevant. If the witness was deemed irrelevant to the case, the trial court, upon consent of\nthe parties, would then dismiss the witness. In cases where either parties, or the witnesses\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                 8\n\n\nthemselves, believed they could provide relevant information, the trial court would proceed\nwith the hearing or ask them to return the following day to testify. One witness, T.H., is\nmost illustrative of the trial court’s vetting process and its willingness to hear testimony.\nDuring the preliminary review of witnesses, the parties initially agreed that T.H. did not\nhave any relevant information to provide in the case. However, T.H. insisted that he had\nevidence against appellant. (Tr. at 15.) The trial court permitted T.H. to testify the\nfollowing day. Upon questioning, T.H. did not have any information about the marriage\nand did not have any relevant testimony. “I don’t know what this case is even about to be\nhonest with you.” (Oct. 27, 2023 Tr. at 70.) The trial court then dismissed the witness. (Tr.\nat 73.) Throughout the hearing, the trial court afforded each party an equitable amount of\ntime to present evidence and witnesses in their case. The trial court’s efforts to limit the\ntestimony to information relevant to the accusation was exceedingly reasonable and a\nlaudable effort to protect the interests of both pro se litigants.\n       {¶ 21} Next, appellant claims that the trial court refused to allow a witness to testify\ndespite its knowledge that they were outside the courtroom. However, appellant fails to\nidentify in his brief the name of the witness or identify in the transcript where this issue\narose. Our review of the record indicates that the trial court permitted the parties to present\nany and all witnesses that were relevant to the allegations in the case. App.R. 16(A)(7)\nrequires an appellant’s brief to include “the contentions of the appellant with respect to\neach assignment of error * * * and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations\nto * * * parts of the record on which appellant relies.” It is not the duty of this court to\nsearch the record for evidence in support of an appellant’s argument as to any alleged error.\n(Further citations omitted.) Estate of DeChellis v. DeChellis, 5th Dist. No. 2018CA00153,\n2019-Ohio-3078, ¶ 37. Appellant also seems to indicate that the trial court should have\nknown that the additional witness should have been called to testify at the hearing. It is\nappellant’s responsibility to call witnesses; if the trial court precludes a particular witness\nfrom providing testimony the issue must be preserved for appeal. While appellant is a pro\nse litigant, he is held to the same standard as litigants with legal representation. C.W. v.\nJ.S., 10th Dist. No. 21AP-284, 2022-Ohio-1951, ¶ 36, citing JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v.\nCloyes, 10th Dist.

Without any citation to the\nrecord, we find appellant’s argument concerning the unidentified witness without merit.\n       {¶ 22} Next, appellant claims that the trial court impermissibly restricted the\npresentation of his case regarding appellee’s mental stability while it let appellee offer\nevidence without interruption. We disagree. While questions as to a witness’s mental\nhealth or stability are occasionally relevant, courts typically require expert testimony to\nconnect how a witness’s purported mental health diagnosis could affect their credibility.\nSee, e.g., State v. Carson, 1st Dist. No. C-180336, 2019-Ohio-4550, ¶ 26, citing State v.\nBrowning, 98 Ohio App. 8, 11 (1st Dist.1954); Evid.R. 702. Here, appellant failed to provide\ntestimony from a physician, or like expert, qualified to testify as to how appellee’s purported\nmental health issues would affect her credibility in this case. Regardless, our review of the\ntranscript reveals that appellant was still able to present his argument to the court based on\nhis personal observations of appellee after their daughter passed away. The trial court’s\nrestriction as to this issue did not deprive appellant of a “full hearing” under the statute.\n       {¶ 23} Finally, appellant argues that the trial court made no effort to hold the\nwitnesses that failed to appear at the full hearing in contempt. (Appellant’s Brief at 7.)\n“This court has generally defined ‘contempt’ as a ‘disregard of, or disobedience to, an order\nor command of judicial authority.’ ” Boyd v. Boyd, 10th Dist. No. 21AP-474, 2022-Ohio-\n4775, ¶ 9, quoting Craig v. Gilchrist, 10th Dist. No. 19AP-804, 2021-Ohio-2199, ¶ 2.\nPursuant to R.C. 2705.02 and its inherent powers, the trial court is authorized to punish\nthe disobedience of its orders with contempt proceedings. Boyd at ¶ 9. “ ‘[T]he primary\ninterest involved in a contempt proceeding is the authority and proper functioning of the\ncourt, [and therefore] great reliance should be placed upon the discretion of the [court].’ ”\nState ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hunter, 138 Ohio St.3d 51, 2013-Ohio-5614, ¶ 29,\nquoting Denovchek v. Bd. of Trumbull Cty. Commrs., 36 Ohio St.3d 14, 16 (1988). Here,\nappellant failed to file a motion, or even make an affirmative request, that the absent\nwitnesses be held in contempt. The record reveals that appellant only made a passing\ninquiry into the issue during the full hearing:\n       [I.S.S.]: But the people that didn’t show up, say they’re just, like, ignoring the\n       subpoena, they probably would be found in contempt of court or what?\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                              10\n\n\n       The Court: There’s a process. You can ask the court to find them in contempt\n       of the subpoena. You probably want to read up on that process. I can’t give\n       you legal advice.\n\n(Oct. 26, 2023 Tr. at 52-53.)\n       {¶ 24} R.C. 2705.02 expressly provides that a person guilty of disobedience of a\ncourt order “may” be punished for contempt. Dureiko v. Dureiko, 8th Dist. No. 94393,\n2010-Ohio-5599, ¶ 14; see also Civ.R. 45(E). Given the facts of the case, we cannot find that\nthe trial court erred by electing not to sua sponte hold the subpoenaed witnesses in\ncontempt.\n       {¶ 25} Taking into consideration all the issues identified by appellant, we are not\npersuaded that the various restrictions imposed by the trial court’s deprived appellant of a\n“full hearing” under the statute.\n       {¶ 26} Appellant’s third and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n       {¶ 27} Having overruled appellant’s four assignments of error, we affirm the\njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations.\n                                                                       Judgment affirmed.\n                           JAMISON and BOGGS, JJ., concur.\n                                    _____________\n\f",

For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n          {¶ 2} On April 14, 2023, appellee filed a DVCPO against appellant. That same day,\nthe trial court granted appellee’s ex parte temporary DVCPO against appellant and set the\nmatter for a full hearing. On April 24, 2023, the trial court continued the scheduled full\nhearing because appellant had not yet been served with the petition and notice of the\nhearing. (May 1, 2023 Order &amp; Entry.) On May 25, 2023, the trial court continued the full\nhearing a second time citing other good cause, to wit: “ongoing trial.” (May 25, 2023 Order\n&amp; Entry.) On September 15, 2023, the trial court continued the full hearing a third time\n\n\n1 Appellee did not file a brief in this case.\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                 2\n\n\nbased on “an ongoing 30+ day trial.” (Capitalization omitted.) (Sept. 20, 2023 Order &amp;\nEntry.) The full hearing was ultimately held on October 26 and October 27, 2023. Upon\nthe completion of the full hearing, the trial court granted the DVCPO against appellant on\nNovember 1, 2023.\n       {¶ 3} Appellant filed a timely appeal.\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n       {¶ 4} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n              [I.] Appellant, having been served with a protection order, was\n              directed to attend court on May 25th, 2023. On the designated\n              date and time, Appellant diligently appeared, only to be\n              unjustly denied the opportunity to address the accusations and\n              alleviate the court’s concerns. Furthermore, Appellant was\n              wrongly deprived of the right to present their case or engage\n              with the appointed judge regarding the matter.\n\n              [II.] Appellant’s entitlement to have their case heard and\n              adjudicated within 30 days, as mandated by Ohio Revised Code\n              3113.31, was unjustly denied. The prescribed procedure was not\n              adhere to, resulting in a violation of Appellant’s rights.\n\n              [III.] Despite the Appellant issuing nearly 30 subpoenas, the\n              court failed to summon all available individuals, neglecting to\n              assess their knowledge of the case or determine the materiality\n              of their testimony to the Appellant’s case.\n\n              [IV.] The Appellant, having obtained evidence pertaining to the\n              mental stability of the Appellee, was unjustly denied the right\n              to present this crucial evidence. In contrast, during opening\n              statements, the Appellee was permitted to speak unchecked for\n              over twenty minutes, delving into matters unrelated to the\n              complaint. However, when it came time to present evidence,\n              the Appellant was unduly restricted being informed that only\n              evidence directly correlating to the Appellee’s written\n              statements would be admissible.\n\nIII. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n       A. Appellant’s First and Second Assignments of Error\n       {¶ 5} In appellant’s first assignment of error, he alleges that the trial court deprived\nhim of his right to present his case at the May 25, 2023 hearing. In appellant’s second\nassignment of error, he alleges that the trial court erred by failing to hold a full hearing\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                              3\n\n\nwithin the statutory requirements of R.C. 3113.31. Because these assignments of error are\nintertwined, we will address them together.\n       {¶ 6} Pursuant to R.C. 3113.31, a petitioner may seek a DVCPO to enjoin the\nrespondent from further violence against the family or household members. Parrish v.\nParrish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6784334\"><a href=\"/opinion/6890258/parrish-v-parrish/#1204\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Parrish v. Parrish\">95 Ohio St.3d 1201, 1204</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2002-Ohio-1623</span><pre class=\"inline\">. If a petitioner requests an ex parte\norder, the trial court must hold a hearing that same day. R.C. 3113.31(D)(1). At the\nconclusion of an ex parte hearing, the trial court, for “good cause shown,” may issue a\ntemporary order at petitioner’s request. R.C. 3113.31(D)(1). If an ex parte DVCPO is put in\nplace, due process and statutory requirements mandate that the trial court “schedule a full\nhearing” within seven court days and provide respondent “notice of, and an opportunity to\nbe heard at, the full hearing.” R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a). However, the trial court “may” grant\na continuance of the full hearing to a reasonable time determined by the court when: (1)\nrespondent has not been served with the petition and notice prior to the date of hearing;\n(2) the parties have consented to a continuance; (3) a continuance is necessary to allow a\nparty to obtain counsel; or (4) the continuance is warranted for other good cause. R.C.\n3113.31(D)(2)(a)(i) through (iv).\n       {¶ 7} While questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law that we\nreview de novo, see, e.g., State v.

As appellate courts have long noted that when vesting the trial court with\ndiscretionary determinations, it is inevitable two trial court judges could have different\nconclusions on what constitutes “good cause.” Diverging discretionary determinations,\nhowever, do not necessarily mean that either decision amounts to an abuse of discretion.\nWaterford Tower Condominium Assn. v.

No.\n05AP-593, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3704439\"><a href=\"/opinion/3955100/waterford-tower-v-transamerica-real-unpublished-decision-2-7-2006/#19\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Waterford Tower v.

R.C. 3113.31 directs that a full hearing must be scheduled within\nseven court days of the ex parte hearing. Upon review, we find that the trial court complied\nwith this statutory directive as the April 24, 2023 full hearing was scheduled within seven\ncourt days of the April 14, 2023 ex parte hearing. The next question is whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by granting multiple continuances prior to the October 26, 2023\nhearing.\n       {¶ 9} Preliminarily, we must resolve whether appellant waived his right to contest\nthe grounds for the various continuances of the full hearing. On September 15, 2023, the\ntrial court continued the full hearing until October 26, 2023 based on an “ongoing 30+ day\ntrial.” (Capitalization omitted.) (Sept. 20, 2023 Order &amp; Entry.) The parties, including\nappellant, signed the September 20 order and continuance entry, which noted “[e]ach party\nwaives the requirement for this matter to be concluded within thirty (30) days.” (Sept. 20,\n2023 Order &amp; Entry.) Similarly, after the parties were not able to complete the full hearing\non October 26, 2023, the trial court continued the case to resume the following day. The\nparties signed a final continuance entry that acknowledged they waived the requirement\nthat this matter be concluded within 30 days. (Nov. 2, 2023 Order &amp; Entry.) Furthermore,\nappellant failed to raise this issue with the trial court at any point during the full hearing.\n“It is axiomatic that a litigant’s failure to raise an issue at the trial court level waives the\nlitigant’s right to raise that issue on appeal.” S.H. v. S.P., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-70, 2013-\nOhio-3833, ¶ 22, citing Shover v. Cordis Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6763545\"><a href=\"/opinion/6871387/shover-v-cordis-corp/#220\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Shover v.

Sotka\">81 Ohio St.3d 506</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998). Thus, appellant has waived\nthe issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion by continuing the full hearing.\n       {¶ 10} Arguendo, even if the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion\nby continuing the full hearing was preserved, we still find appellant’s second assignment of\nerror unavailing.      As set forth previously, R.C. 3113.31(D)(2) provides specific\ncircumstances that permit the trial court to grant a continuance. We will address each\ncontinuance and the cited justification in turn.\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                5\n\n\n       {¶ 11} The trial court first continued the April 24, 2023 full hearing as appellant had\nnot yet been served with the petition and notice of the full hearing. (May 1, 2023 Order &amp;\nEntry.) R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a)(i) expressly permits the trial court to continue the hearing\nfor this exact reason. The trial court continued the full hearing on two more occasions\nbecause of ongoing trials. “[A] court has supervisory control over its own docket and has\nthe inherent authority to manage its own proceedings and grant continuances.” R.J.L. v.\nK.R., 8th Dist. No. 108228, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019-Ohio-3667</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 19, citing State ex rel. Buck v.

McCabe\">140\nOhio St. 535, 537</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1942) (finding the trial court did not abuse its discretion by continuing a\nfull hearing based on its “congested trial schedule”).        We find that the trial court’s\ncontinuances based on other ongoing trials were reasonable as they would fall under the\ncategory of “other good cause.” R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a)(iv). The final continuance order was\nfiled as the trial court needed an additional day to conclude the full hearing. Because of the\nnumber of witnesses that were subpoenaed by the parties, it is reasonable to conclude that\nthe matter required an additional day of testimony. Moreover, appellant suffered no\nprejudice from the various continuances. With the additional time, appellant was able to\nfamiliarize himself with the petition and issue numerous subpoenas to witnesses to appear\nat the full hearing.    Appellant acknowledges as much in his brief stating that the\ncontinuance “puzzled me, as it seemingly benefited me at the request of my accuser.”\n(Appellant’s Brief at 6.)\n       {¶ 12} For the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant waived the statutory\nrequirements as evidenced by his signature on the two continuance entries and failure to\nraise the issue prior to the full hearing. Alternatively, we do not find that the trial court\nabused its discretion by continuing the full hearing as the cited justifications for the\ncontinuances fall under the statute’s available exceptions.\n       {¶ 13} Appellant next claims that he was denied his right to be present during the\nMay 25, 2023 hearing. Appellant argues that he never signed the May 25, 2023 order and\nentry and did not consent to the continuance. Appellant contends that he appeared for the\nMay 25 hearing only to be informed that the matter was continued.\n       {¶ 14} The record indicates that appellee filed her ex parte order on April 14, 2023\nand the original full hearing was scheduled for April 24, 2023. The trial court continued\nthe April 24, 2023 hearing until May 25, 2023 due to the lack of service of the petition and\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                  6\n\n\nnotice on appellant. (May 1, 2023 Order &amp; Entry.) While appellant was apparently served\nwith “the ex parte/petition continuance” on May 23, 2023, the order was not filed with the\ntrial court until May 26, 2023. (Capitalization omitted.) (May 26, 2023 Order to Serve.)\nAccordingly, we can reasonably infer that the court was not aware of service on appellant\nuntil after the May 25, 2023 hearing was continued. While appellant claims that he\n“arriv[ed] [at the courthouse] early with the order in hand,” we do not have a transcript of\nthe May 25, 2023 proceedings to verify this claim. (Appellant’s Brief at 6.) Given the lack\nof a transcript, we presume the regularity of trial court’s proceeding as documented in the\ncourt’s May 25, 2023 entry. State ex rel. Bardwell v.

Based on the date that the notice of service was filed with the\ntrial court, as well as appellant’s statement that he was out of the country on May 25, 2023,\nwe find appellant’s first assignment of error is without merit.\n       {¶ 15} Appellant’s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n       B. Appellant’s Third and Fourth Assignments of Error\n       {¶ 16} In appellant’s third assignment of error, he contends that the trial court failed\nto summon all available individuals to testify at the full hearing. Similarly, appellant’s final\nassignment of error argues the trial court erred by not allowing him to question appellee as\nto her mental stability but allowed appellee to testify on matters unrelated to the complaint\nwithout objection. As these assignments of error are interrelated, we will address them\ntogether.\n       {¶ 17} The heart of appellant’s contention is that he was deprived of the ability to\npresent his case during the hearing. Stated another way, appellant contends he was denied\na “full hearing” under the statute. In cases where an appeal requires an analysis of R.C.\n3113.31, we apply a de novo standard of review.

Oteng, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-466, 2015-Ohio-\n1231, ¶ 31.\n       {¶ 19} Appellant first argues that the trial court improperly restricted his witnesses\nto those that were “directly relevant to the accusation.” (Appellant’s Brief at 6.) Upon\nreview of the hearing transcript, the trial court patiently waded through the many witnesses\nthat appeared, in person and over Zoom, in compliance with the subpoenas issued by the\nparties. The trial court worked with the parties, both pro se litigations, to determine if each\nwitness had relevant information to provide as to the allegations in appellee’s affidavit.\n       {¶ 20} At the start of the hearing, the trial court informed the parties that it was\ngoing to first inquire of each witness their name, relationship to the parties, and\ninformation they may have in the case. (Oct. 26, 2023 Tr. at 4.) The trial court noted that\nthe case is limited to the events in the allegation, and he would dismiss witnesses that were\nnot relevant to the claims at issue. During the initial vetting of the subpoenaed individuals,\nthe parties conferred with the trial court whether they believed a particular witness was\nrelevant. If the witness was deemed irrelevant to the case, the trial court, upon consent of\nthe parties, would then dismiss the witness. In cases where either parties, or the witnesses\n\fNo. 23AP-663                                                                                 8\n\n\nthemselves, believed they could provide relevant information, the trial court would proceed\nwith the hearing or ask them to return the following day to testify. One witness, T.H., is\nmost illustrative of the trial court’s vetting process and its willingness to hear testimony.\nDuring the preliminary review of witnesses, the parties initially agreed that T.H. did not\nhave any relevant information to provide in the case. However, T.H. insisted that he had\nevidence against appellant. (Tr. at 15.) The trial court permitted T.H. to testify the\nfollowing day. Upon questioning, T.H. did not have any information about the marriage\nand did not have any relevant testimony. “I don’t know what this case is even about to be\nhonest with you.” (Oct. 27, 2023 Tr. at 70.) The trial court then dismissed the witness. (Tr.\nat 73.) Throughout the hearing, the trial court afforded each party an equitable amount of\ntime to present evidence and witnesses in their case. The trial court’s efforts to limit the\ntestimony to information relevant to the accusation was exceedingly reasonable and a\nlaudable effort to protect the interests of both pro se litigants.\n       {¶ 21} Next, appellant claims that the trial court refused to allow a witness to testify\ndespite its knowledge that they were outside the courtroom. However, appellant fails to\nidentify in his brief the name of the witness or identify in the transcript where this issue\narose. Our review of the record indicates that the trial court permitted the parties to present\nany and all witnesses that were relevant to the allegations in the case. App.R. 16(A)(7)\nrequires an appellant’s brief to include “the contentions of the appellant with respect to\neach assignment of error * * * and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations\nto * * * parts of the record on which appellant relies.” It is not the duty of this court to\nsearch the record for evidence in support of an appellant’s argument as to any alleged error.\n(Further citations omitted.)

Appellant also seems to indicate that the trial court should have\nknown that the additional witness should have been called to testify at the hearing. It is\nappellant’s responsibility to call witnesses; if the trial court precludes a particular witness\nfrom providing testimony the issue must be preserved for appeal.

Without any citation to the\nrecord, we find appellant’s argument concerning the unidentified witness without merit.\n       {¶ 22} Next, appellant claims that the trial court impermissibly restricted the\npresentation of his case regarding appellee’s mental stability while it let appellee offer\nevidence without interruption. We disagree. While questions as to a witness’s mental\nhealth or stability are occasionally relevant, courts typically require expert testimony to\nconnect how a witness’s purported mental health diagnosis could affect their credibility.\nSee, e.g., State v. Carson, 1st Dist. No. C-180336, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4453290\"><a href=\"/opinion/4676037/state-v-carson/#26\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v.

Here, appellant failed to provide\ntestimony from a physician, or like expert, qualified to testify as to how appellee’s purported\nmental health issues would affect her credibility in this case. Regardless, our review of the\ntranscript reveals that appellant was still able to present his argument to the court based on\nhis personal observations of appellee after their daughter passed away. The trial court’s\nrestriction as to this issue did not deprive appellant of a “full hearing” under the statute.\n       {¶ 23} Finally, appellant argues that the trial court made no effort to hold the\nwitnesses that failed to appear at the full hearing in contempt. (Appellant’s Brief at 7.)\n“This court has generally defined ‘contempt’ as a ‘disregard of, or disobedience to, an order\nor command of judicial authority.’ ” Boyd v. Boyd, 10th Dist.

Here,\nappellant failed to file a motion, or even make an affirmative request, that the absent\nwitnesses be held in contempt.

GRAY, CATONSVILLE, MARYLAND, ATTORNEY FOR THE CHILD. </p>\n<br><br>\n\n<p>\tAppeal from an order of the Family Court, Monroe County (Alecia J. Mazzo, J.), entered June 28, 2023, in a proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law § 384-b. The order, inter alia, terminated the parental rights of respondent with respect to the subject child. </p>\n<p>It is hereby ORDERED that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p>Memorandum: In this proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law § 384-b, petitioner moved by order to show cause to revoke a suspended judgment entered upon, inter alia, the admission of respondent father that he had permanently neglected the subject child. The father appeals from an order by which Family Court, inter alia, effectively granted petitioner's motion and terminated the father's parental rights with respect to the subject child. We affirm.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we reject petitioner's contention that the appeal should be dismissed as untimely. Inasmuch as there is no evidence in the record of when the order was served on the father, \"we cannot determine on this record when, if ever, the time to take the appeal[ ] began to run, and thus it cannot be said\" that the father's appeal is untimely (<i>Matter of Bukowski v Florentino</i>, 210 AD3d 1520, 1521 [4th Dept 2022]; <i>see also Matter of Grayson S. [Thomas S.]</i>, 209 AD3d 1309, 1310-1311 [4th Dept 2022]).</p>\n<p>With respect to the merits, it is well settled that, \"[w]here petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been noncompliance with any of the terms of the suspended judgment, the court may revoke the suspended judgment and terminate parental rights\" (<i>Matter of Ramel H. [Tenese T.]</i>, 134 AD3d 1590, 1592 [4th Dept 2015] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see </i>Family Ct Act § 633 [f]; <i>Matter of Ronald O.</i>, 43 AD3d 1351, 1352 [4th Dept 2007]). \"[L]iteral compliance with the terms of the suspended judgment will not suffice to prevent a finding of a violation. A parent must [also] show that progress has been made to overcome the specific problems which led to the removal of the child[ ]\" (<i>Matter of Joseph M.</i>,<i> Jr. [Joseph M.</i>,<i> Sr.]</i>, 150 AD3d 1647, 1648 [4th Dept 2017], <i>lv denied</i> 29 NY3d 917 [2017] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Matter of Maykayla FF. [Eugene FF.]</i>, 141 AD3d 898, 899 [3d Dept 2016]). Further, \"a hearing on a [motion] alleging that the terms of a suspended judgment have been violated is part of the dispositional phase of the permanent neglect proceeding, and . . . the disposition shall be based on the best interests of the child\" (<i>Matter of Jenna D. [Paula D.]</i>, 165 AD3d 1617, 1619 [4th Dept 2018], <i>lv denied </i>32 NY3d 912 [2019] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Contrary to the father's contention, the record establishes that he violated the suspended judgment order by, inter alia, failing to undergo a [*2]mental health evaluation within 30 days of the order, failing to maintain stable and suitable housing, and violating the prohibition on discussing \"the instant case, the [c]hild's caretakers, [p]etitioner, or any other legal matter\" in front of the subject child. Again, the failure to comply with \" 'any of the terms of the suspended judgment' \" permits the court to revoke the suspended judgment (<i>Joseph M.</i>,<i> Jr.</i>, 150 AD3d at 1648).</p>\n<p>Finally, a preponderance of the evidence supports the court's determination that it was in the child's best interests to terminate the father's parental rights (<i>see Jenna D.</i>, 165 AD3d at 1619; <i>Matter of Mikel B. [Carlos B.]</i>, 115 AD3d 1348, 1349 [4th Dept 2014]). \"Although [the father's] breach of the express conditions of the suspended judgment does not compel the termination of [his] parental rights, [it] is strong evidence that termination is, in fact, in the best interests of the child[ ]\" (<i>Jenna D.</i>, 165 AD3d at 1619 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Matter of Michael HH. [Michael II.]</i>, 124 AD3d 944, 945-946 [3d Dept 2015]). Here, \"any progress that [the father] made was not sufficient to warrant any further prolongation of the child['s] unsettled familial status\" (<i>Matter of Brendan S.</i>, 39 AD3d 1189, 1190 [4th Dept 2007] [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the father's remaining contention and conclude that it does not warrant modification or reversal of the order.</p>\n<p>Entered: May 2, 2025</p>\n<p>Ann Dillon Flynn</p>\n<p>Clerk of the Court</p>\n\n\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

O'Donoghue, J.), entered April 1, 2021. The order, insofar as appealed from by the defendants Benjamin Hentel and DRA Imaging, P.C., denied that branch of the motion of those defendants and the defendants Jon Lewis and Joseph Antonio which was for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendants Benjamin Hentel and DRA Imaging, P.C. The order, insofar as appealed from by the defendant Richard Jiao, denied that defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with one bill of costs payable by the appellants appearing separately and filing separate briefs.</p>\n<p>The infant plaintiff was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta (hereinafter OI) in January 2013. Subsequently, the infant plaintiff, by his mother, and his mother, individually, commenced separate actions, which were subsequently consolidated, against, among others, the defendants Benjamin Hentel, DRA Imaging, P.C. (hereinafter DRA), which was Hentel's employer, and Richard Jiao, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that Jiao failed to detect the infant plaintiff's leg fracture on a September 26, 2011 X-ray and that Hentel failed to detect rib fractures on a February 15, 2012 CT scan, which resulted in, among other things, a delayed diagnosis of OI, complications, and additional fractures. Jiao moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him, and Hentel, DRA, and other defendants moved (hereinafter the Hentel motion), inter alia, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against Hentel and DRA. In an order entered April 1, 2021, the Supreme Court, among other things, denied Jiao's motion and denied that branch of the Hentel motion. Hentel and DRA appeal, and Jiao separately appeals.</p>\n<p>\"On a motion for summary judgment dismissing a cause of action alleging medical malpractice, the defendant bears the initial burden of establishing that there was no departure from good and accepted medical practice or that any alleged departure did not proximately cause the plaintiff's injuries\" (<i>Revellino v Haimovic</i>, 216 AD3d 687, 688, citing <i>Pirri-Logan v Pearl</i>, 192 AD3d 1149, 1150). A defendant moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must demonstrate the absence of any material issues of fact as to at least one of these elements, and to meet that burden, he or she must submit in admissible form factual proof to rebut a claim of malpractice (<i>see Glassman v Caremount Med., P.C.</i>, 226 AD3d 878). If the defendant makes such a showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to raise a triable issue of fact as to those elements on which the defendant met his or her prima facie burden of proof (<i>see Revellino v Haimovic</i>, 216 AD3d at 688, citing <i>Alvarez v Prospect Hosp.</i>, 68 NY2d 320, 324).</p>\n<p>Here, the Supreme Court did not err in denying that branch of the Hentel motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against Hentel and DRA. Although the movants established, prima facie, Hentel's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by demonstrating that Hentel did not deviate from the accepted standard of care given the information he had at the time he interpreted the February 15, 2012 CT scan and that any departure was not a proximate cause of the infant plaintiff's injuries, in opposition, the plaintiffs raised triable issues of fact as to whether Hentel departed from good and accepted medical practice and as to whether his departure proximately caused additional fractures (<i>see Maestri v Pasha</i>, 198 AD3d 632; <i>Polanco v Reed</i>, 105 AD3d 438). For the same reason, DRA was not entitled to summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it with respect to Hentel's alleged conduct (<i>cf. Wijesinghe v Buena Vida Corp.</i>, 210 AD3d 824).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court did not err in denying Jiao's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him. Jiao established, prima facie, through his expert's affidavit, that identifying and reporting the fracture in the September 26, 2011 X-ray would not have been a basis upon which Jiao could have been expected to diagnose OI without other indications and that OI is characterized by the occurrence of multiple bone fractures. However, in response, the plaintiffs submitted an expert's affidavit that raised a triable issue of fact as to whether Jiao's alleged departure in failing to recognize the fracture in the September 26, 2011 X-ray resulted in the fracture progressing from a simple fracture to a complex transverse and spiral fracture, causing the infant plaintiff unnecessary pain and suffering and increasing his injury (<i>see D.Y. v Catskill Regional Med. Ctr.</i>, 156 AD3d 1003).</p>\n<p>BARROS, J.P., DOWLING, VENTURA and MCCORMACK, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Cruz, for\n                 appellant.\n\n                 Lisa A. Hahn, for appellee.\n\n\nEILEEN T. GALLAGHER, P.J.:\n\n                Appellant M.J.S. (“Father”) appeals the judgment of the trial court\n\nfinding him in contempt of court for failing to enroll his children in the Medina City\n\nSchool District pursuant to the parties’ agreed judgment entry amending their\n\nshared-parenting plan. He raises one assignment of error:\n\f      The trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion by\n      finding that the appellant was in contempt of the November 10, 2016\n      agreed judgment entry.\n\n            After a thorough review of the applicable law and facts, we reverse the\n\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n                      I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n            Appellee C.S.S. (“Mother”) and Father’s marriage was dissolved\n\npursuant to a judgment entry of dissolution filed December 2, 2015. Two children\n\nwere born as issue of the marriage. As a part of the dissolution, the parties entered\n\ninto a shared-parenting plan. Within this plan, Father was designated as the\n\nresidential parent for school purposes. The shared-parenting plan also stated that\n\nif the parties could not agree regarding education-related matters, Father would\n\nhave final decision-making authority.\n\n             The shared-parenting plan was modified on November 10, 2016, via\n\nagreed judgment entry (the “agreed judgment entry”). The entry stated that “the\n\nchildren shall continue to attend school in the district Father resides.” At the time\n\nof the agreed judgment entry, Father resided in the Medina City School District.\n\n            In August 2023, while still residing in the Medina City School District,\n\nFather withdrew the children from the Medina City School District and began\n\nhomeschooling them; the children also received supplemental tutoring.\n\n             Mother filed a motion to show cause, arguing that Father had violated\n\nthe agreed judgment entry by withdrawing the children from the Medina City School\n\fDistrict and homeschooling them instead. Mother also moved to modify the shared-\n\nparenting plan.\n\n            Father filed a brief in opposition to the motion and moved to dismiss\n\nthe proceedings. He asserted that regardless of the agreed judgment entry, he\n\nretained final decision-making authority regarding the children’s education.\n\n             In December 2023, the magistrate held a hearing on the motions,\n\nwhere both Mother and Father appeared and testified.\n\n             The magistrate later issued a decision, granting Mother’s motion to\n\nshow cause and denying as moot Father’s motion to dismiss and Mother’s motion to\n\nmodify shared parenting. The magistrate found by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat Father had violated the agreed judgment entry that stated that the children\n\n“shall continue to attend school in the district Father resides.” The magistrate held\n\nthat this modified term restricted Father’s final decision-making authority\n\nregarding the children’s education. The court further found that homeschooling\n\nwith tutor supplementation was not consistent with the terms of the agreed\n\njudgment entry.\n\n              Father was found to be in contempt of court and sentenced to 30 days\n\nin jail. The sentence was suspended, and Father was permitted to purge his\n\ncontempt by reenrolling the children back into the Medina City School District\n\nwithin 15 days of the release of the magistrate’s decision.\n\n             Father filed objections to the magistrate’s decision, arguing that the\n\nmagistrate incorrectly stated that the parties had intended in the agreed judgment\n\fentry for the children to “continue to attend” school in the school district in which\n\nFather resided when, in reality, neither child had been old enough to attend school\n\nat the time of the agreed judgment entry. In addition, Father asserted that the\n\nchildren were enrolled in the Medina City School District but that they were exempt\n\nfrom attending and were authorized to receive “home education.”\n\n              The court overruled Father’s objections and adopted the magistrate’s\n\ndecision. Father then filed the instant appeal.\n\n                              II. Law and Analysis\n\n              In his sole assignment of error, Father argues that the trial court erred\n\nas a matter of law and abused its discretion when it found that he was in contempt\n\nof the November 10, 2016 agreed judgment entry.\n\n              “Contempt is defined as a disregard of, or disobedience to, an order or\n\ncommand of judicial authority.” Palnik v. Crane, 2019-Ohio-3364, ¶ 54 (8th Dist.).\n\n“The purpose of contempt proceedings is to secure the dignity of the courts and the\n\nuninterrupted and unimpeded administration of justice.”           Windham Bank v.\n\nTomaszczyk, 27 Ohio St.2d 55 (1971), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n              Contempt can be either direct or indirect. In re J.M., 2008-Ohio-\n\n6763, ¶ 46 (12th Dist.). Direct contempt involves “misbehavior in the presence of or\n\nso near the court or judge as to obstruct the administration of justice.” R.C. 2705.01.\n\nIndirect contempt involves acts occurring outside the presence of the court that\n\ndemonstrate a lack of respect for the court or its lawful orders. R.C. 2705.02; In re\n\nLance, 2016-Ohio-2717, ¶ 12 (8th Dist.).\n\f                Contempt is further classified as either civil or criminal. Oak Hill\n\nBanks v. Ison, 2003-Ohio-5547, ¶ 14 (4th Dist.). “This distinction depends largely\n\nupon the character and purpose of the punishment imposed.” Id. Whereas criminal\n\ncontempt is solely punitive, civil contempt contemplates punishment that is\n\nremedial or coercive and for the benefit of the complainant. Brown v. Executive\n\n200, Inc., 64 Ohio St.2d 250, 253 (1980). Although a prison sentence may be\n\nimposed in cases of civil contempt, the contemnor must be afforded the opportunity\n\nto purge the contempt. Id. “‘Once the contemnor purges his contempt, any\n\nsanctions will be discontinued because compliance has been achieved.’” In re Lance\n\nat ¶ 13, quoting U.S. Bank Natl. Assn. v. Golf Course Mgt., Inc., 2009-Ohio-2807,\n\n¶ 16 (12th Dist.).\n\n                This case involves indirect civil contempt because the court\n\ndetermined that Father violated a court order, imposed a suspended jail sentence,\n\nand afforded Father an opportunity to purge the contempt. To establish civil\n\ncontempt, the complainant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence the\n\nexistence of a valid court order, that the respondent had knowledge of the order, and\n\na violation of the order. In re K.B., 2012-Ohio-5507, ¶ 77 (8th Dist.). Once the prima\n\nfacie case of contempt has been established by clear and convincing evidence, the\n\nburden shifts to the nonmoving party to either rebut the initial showing of contempt\n\nor establish an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. K.M.M. v.\n\nA.J.T., 2021-Ohio-2452, ¶ 24 (8th Dist.), citing Allen v. Allen, 2003-Ohio-954, ¶ 16\n\n(10th Dist.).\n\f              “Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof . . .\n\nwhich will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to\n\nthe facts sought to be established.” Cross v. Ledford, 161 Ohio St. 469 (1954),\n\nparagraph three of the syllabus. However, the determination of contempt is within\n\nthe trial court’s discretion and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.\n\nCleveland v. Heben, 74 Ohio App.3d 568, 573 (8th Dist. 1991). An abuse of\n\ndiscretion occurs when a court exercises “its judgment, in an unwarranted way, in\n\nregard to a matter over which it has discretionary authority.” Johnson v. Abdullah,\n\n2021-Ohio-3304, ¶ 35.\n\n              As a preliminary matter, Father first argues that the trial court\n\nimproperly determined that he violated the agreed judgment entry, while Mother’s\n\nmotion to show cause only asserted that he had violated the shared-parenting plan.\n\nHowever, it does not appear that this issue was raised at the trial-court level, and\n\nthus, was not properly presented for review in this appeal. A basic tenet of appellate\n\njurisdiction is that a party may not raise an argument on appeal that was not raised\n\nbelow. Goldfuss v. Davidson, 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 121 (1997). “A party who fails to\n\nraise an issue in the trial court waives the right to raise it on appeal.” Rimmer v.\n\nCitiFinancial, Inc., 2020-Ohio-99, ¶ 37 (8th Dist.), citing Harding Pointe, Inc. v.\n\nOhio Dept. of Job & Family Servs., 2013-Ohio-4885, ¶ 43 (10th Dist.).\n\n               Turning to the prima facie case of contempt, there is no dispute that a\n\ncourt order existed, to wit: the agreed judgment entry that amended the parties’\n\nshared-parenting plan. There also does not appear to be any argument that Father\n\fwas unaware of this order. Father testified that he was aware of “the prior order”\n\nthat stated that the children were to “continue to attend school” in the district in\n\nwhich he resided. Accordingly, the only question to be determined is whether the\n\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that there was clear and convincing\n\nevidence that Father violated the agreed judgment entry.\n\n              “Ohio provides a home education exception to the requirement of\n\ncompulsory school attendance which recognizes the rights of parents to educate\n\ntheir children at home.” Gatchel v. Gatchel, 2005-Ohio-148, ¶ 10 (3d Dist.), citing\n\nR.C. 3321.04(A)(2). The statute requires that the parent(s) obtain an excuse from\n\ncompulsory school attendance from the superintendent of the school district in\n\nwhich the child resides. “The right of parents to educate their children at home is\n\nqualified and subject to reasonable government regulations designed to [e]nsure\n\nthat minimum standards of education prescribed by the State are met, consistent\n\nwith the State’s compelling interest in [en]suring that all of its citizens receive a\n\nquality basic education.” Id. at ¶ 11, citing State v. Schmidt, 29 Ohio St.3d 32 (1987).\n\n              Father argues that since the children were homeschooled within the\n\nMedina City School District, he was in compliance with the agreed judgment entry.\n\nWe note that the agreed judgment entry does not specify whether the children are\n\nto attend in-person school within the Medina City School District or if\n\nhomeschooling is permitted. As this court has noted:\n\n      “A trial court cannot impose contempt sanctions on a party if the party\n      cannot know whether or not its actions violate the trial court’s order.\n      Merely because the trial court knew what its order meant does not\n\f      mean the parties knew what the order meant.” Contos v. Monroe Cty.,\n      2004-Ohio-6380, ¶ 24 (7th Dist.). “Thus, although general arguments\n      that the alleged contemnor lacked intent or misunderstood the court\n      order are invalid defenses, where the trial court’s order is subject to\n      more than one reasonable interpretation, contempt is not the proper\n      remedy.” Rohr v. Williams, 2007-Ohio-7207, ¶ 38 (7th Dist.).\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Perkins v. Gorski, 2013-Ohio-265, ¶ 15 (8th Dist.).\n\n              This matter involves an agreed judgment entry that amended the\n\nparties’ shared-parenting plan. “An agreed judgment entry is a contract that is\n\nreduced to judgment by a court.” Sovak v. Spivey, 2003-Ohio-6717, ¶ 25 (7th Dist.),\n\nciting Spercel v. Sterling Indus., Inc., 31 Ohio St.2d 36, 39 (1972). We, therefore,\n\napply the same rules of construction to an agreed judgment entry as we apply to\n\ncontracts. Dvorak v. Petronzio, 2007-Ohio-4957, ¶ 18 (11th Dist.), quoting Phillips\n\nv. Phillips, 2007-Ohio-3368, ¶ 34 (11th Dist.). (“‘[A]n agreed judgment entry is\n\nsubject to the same rules of construction as a contract.’”)\n\n              In interpreting contracts, the court’s role is “to give effect to the intent\n\nof the parties to the agreement.” Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, 2003-Ohio-5849, ¶ 11,\n\nciting Hamilton Ins. Servs. v. Nationwide Ins. Cos., 86 Ohio St.3d 270, 273 (1999).\n\nWhere the contract terms are clear and unambiguous, we may determine the parties’\n\nrights and obligations from the plain language of the contract. Aultman Hosp. Assn.\n\nv. Community Mut. Ins. Co., 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53 (1989). The interpretation of a\n\nwritten contract is a matter of law. Saunders v. Mortensen, 2004-Ohio-24, ¶ 9.\n\n              The magistrate’s decision, which was adopted by the trial court,\n\nerroneously stated that the children were attending elementary school within the\n\fMedina City School District at the time of the agreed judgment entry. As Father and\n\nMother both acknowledge, at the time of the agreed judgment entry, the children\n\nhad not yet reached kindergarten age and were therefore not attending school. It is\n\nunclear why the parties stated in the agreed judgment entry that the children would\n\n“continue to attend” school in the school district Father resides when they had not\n\nyet started attending school.\n\n              Mother’s motion to show cause asserted that the children were to\n\n“attend the school in the school system where [Father] resides”; however, the agreed\n\njudgment entry did not mention “the school system.” Mother has essentially\n\nadvocated for what she would like the agreed judgment entry to mean today (that\n\nthe children should continue to attend the in-person public school that they had\n\nbeen attending since kindergarten); however, there was no evidence presented as to\n\nthe intent of the parties at the time of the negotiation of the agreed judgment entry\n\n— before the children began attending school.\n\n              Beyond the geographical limitation of the “school district Father\n\nresides,” the agreed judgment entry is silent as to any parameters regarding the type\n\nof school the children could attend. It does not specify whether the children could\n\nbe homeschooled within the Medina City School District or whether they were to\n\nattend school in person. While it does seem apparent that at least Mother meant\n\n“in-person school” in agreeing to that provision, we cannot say that the language of\n\nthe agreed judgment entry was clear enough to find, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, that Father violated the provision by homeschooling the children.\n\f                We conclude that the parties’ use of the words “attend school in the\n\ndistrict Father resides,” without further specificity, was subject to dual\n\ninterpretations and, therefore, ambiguous. Accordingly, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding Father in contempt of the November 10, 2016 agreed judgment\n\nentry.\n\n                Judgment reversed.\n\n         It is ordered that appellant recover from appellee costs herein taxed.\n\n         The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n         It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court, domestic relations division, to carry this judgment into\n\nexecution.\n\n         A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nEILEEN T.

(“Father”) appeals the judgment of the trial court\n\nfinding him in contempt of court for failing to enroll his children in the Medina City\n\nSchool District pursuant to the parties’ agreed judgment entry amending their\n\nshared-parenting plan. He raises one assignment of error:\n\f      The trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion by\n      finding that the appellant was in contempt of the November 10, 2016\n      agreed judgment entry.\n\n            After a thorough review of the applicable law and facts, we reverse the\n\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n                      I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n            Appellee C.S.S. (“Mother”) and Father’s marriage was dissolved\n\npursuant to a judgment entry of dissolution filed December 2, 2015. Two children\n\nwere born as issue of the marriage. As a part of the dissolution, the parties entered\n\ninto a shared-parenting plan. Within this plan, Father was designated as the\n\nresidential parent for school purposes. The shared-parenting plan also stated that\n\nif the parties could not agree regarding education-related matters, Father would\n\nhave final decision-making authority.\n\n             The shared-parenting plan was modified on November 10, 2016, via\n\nagreed judgment entry (the “agreed judgment entry”). The entry stated that “the\n\nchildren shall continue to attend school in the district Father resides.” At the time\n\nof the agreed judgment entry, Father resided in the Medina City School District.\n\n            In August 2023, while still residing in the Medina City School District,\n\nFather withdrew the children from the Medina City School District and began\n\nhomeschooling them; the children also received supplemental tutoring.\n\n             Mother filed a motion to show cause, arguing that Father had violated\n\nthe agreed judgment entry by withdrawing the children from the Medina City School\n\fDistrict and homeschooling them instead. Mother also moved to modify the shared-\n\nparenting plan.\n\n            Father filed a brief in opposition to the motion and moved to dismiss\n\nthe proceedings. He asserted that regardless of the agreed judgment entry, he\n\nretained final decision-making authority regarding the children’s education.\n\n             In December 2023, the magistrate held a hearing on the motions,\n\nwhere both Mother and Father appeared and testified.\n\n             The magistrate later issued a decision, granting Mother’s motion to\n\nshow cause and denying as moot Father’s motion to dismiss and Mother’s motion to\n\nmodify shared parenting. The magistrate found by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat Father had violated the agreed judgment entry that stated that the children\n\n“shall continue to attend school in the district Father resides.” The magistrate held\n\nthat this modified term restricted Father’s final decision-making authority\n\nregarding the children’s education. The court further found that homeschooling\n\nwith tutor supplementation was not consistent with the terms of the agreed\n\njudgment entry.\n\n              Father was found to be in contempt of court and sentenced to 30 days\n\nin jail. The sentence was suspended, and Father was permitted to purge his\n\ncontempt by reenrolling the children back into the Medina City School District\n\nwithin 15 days of the release of the magistrate’s decision.\n\n             Father filed objections to the magistrate’s decision, arguing that the\n\nmagistrate incorrectly stated that the parties had intended in the agreed judgment\n\fentry for the children to “continue to attend” school in the school district in which\n\nFather resided when, in reality, neither child had been old enough to attend school\n\nat the time of the agreed judgment entry. In addition, Father asserted that the\n\nchildren were enrolled in the Medina City School District but that they were exempt\n\nfrom attending and were authorized to receive “home education.”\n\n              The court overruled Father’s objections and adopted the magistrate’s\n\ndecision. Father then filed the instant appeal.\n\n                              II. Law and Analysis\n\n              In his sole assignment of error, Father argues that the trial court erred\n\nas a matter of law and abused its discretion when it found that he was in contempt\n\nof the November 10, 2016 agreed judgment entry.\n\n              “Contempt is defined as a disregard of, or disobedience to, an order or\n\ncommand of judicial authority.” Palnik v.

There also does not appear to be any argument that Father\n\fwas unaware of this order. Father testified that he was aware of “the prior order”\n\nthat stated that the children were to “continue to attend school” in the district in\n\nwhich he resided. Accordingly, the only question to be determined is whether the\n\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that there was clear and convincing\n\nevidence that Father violated the agreed judgment entry.\n\n              “Ohio provides a home education exception to the requirement of\n\ncompulsory school attendance which recognizes the rights of parents to educate\n\ntheir children at home.” Gatchel v.

As this court has noted:\n\n      “A trial court cannot impose contempt sanctions on a party if the party\n      cannot know whether or not its actions violate the trial court’s order.\n      Merely because the trial court knew what its order meant does not\n\f      mean the parties knew what the order meant.” Contos v.

It is\n\nunclear why the parties stated in the agreed judgment entry that the children would\n\n“continue to attend” school in the school district Father resides when they had not\n\nyet started attending school.\n\n              Mother’s motion to show cause asserted that the children were to\n\n“attend the school in the school system where [Father] resides”; however, the agreed\n\njudgment entry did not mention “the school system.” Mother has essentially\n\nadvocated for what she would like the agreed judgment entry to mean today (that\n\nthe children should continue to attend the in-person public school that they had\n\nbeen attending since kindergarten); however, there was no evidence presented as to\n\nthe intent of the parties at the time of the negotiation of the agreed judgment entry\n\n— before the children began attending school.\n\n              Beyond the geographical limitation of the “school district Father\n\nresides,” the agreed judgment entry is silent as to any parameters regarding the type\n\nof school the children could attend. It does not specify whether the children could\n\nbe homeschooled within the Medina City School District or whether they were to\n\nattend school in person. While it does seem apparent that at least Mother meant\n\n“in-person school” in agreeing to that provision, we cannot say that the language of\n\nthe agreed judgment entry was clear enough to find, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, that Father violated the provision by homeschooling the children.\n\f                We conclude that the parties’ use of the words “attend school in the\n\ndistrict Father resides,” without further specificity, was subject to dual\n\ninterpretations and, therefore, ambiguous. Accordingly, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding Father in contempt of the November 10, 2016 agreed judgment\n\nentry.\n\n                Judgment reversed.\n\n         It is ordered that appellant recover from appellee costs herein taxed.\n\n         The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n         It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court, domestic relations division, to carry this judgment into\n\nexecution.\n\n         A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nEILEEN T. GALLAGHER, PRESIDING JUDGE\n\nANITA LASTER MAYS, J., and\nWILLIAM A. KLATT, J.,* CONCUR\n\n(*Sitting by assignment: William A. Klatt, J., retired, of the Tenth District Court of\nAppeals.)\n\f</pre>",

AD22902694 and\n\nAD22902695.1 Y.M., (“Mother”), appeals the decisions of the trial court granting\n\n\n        1 Because the filings in both cases are nearly identical, citations to the record will\n\nbe to Case No. AD22902694, unless a more specific citation is warranted.\n\flegal custody of S.D.M. to Father2 and permanent custody of S.S. to plaintiff-\n\nappellee, Cuyahoga County Division of Children and Family Services (“the Agency”).\n\nAfter careful review of the record, we affirm.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\n               On March 15, 2022, Mother’s two children, S.S. (nine-years-old) and\n\nS.D.M. (one-year-old) were removed from Mother’s care after law enforcement\n\nresponded to Mother’s home and found the children alone. S.S. had been in the legal\n\ncustody of a relative since her removal in 2018 and was visiting Mother that day.3\n\n               On March 16, 2022, the Agency filed a complaint for neglect, abuse\n\n(S.S.), dependency (S.D.M.) and temporary custody, as well as a motion for pre-\n\ndispositional temporary custody. That same day emergency custody was granted to\n\nthe Agency for both children. A case plan was developed and implemented in an\n\nattempt to reunify the children with Mother. S.D.M.’s Father participated at the\n\ntrial-court level, while S.S.’s father did not.\n\n               In August 2022, S.S. was adjudicated abused and neglected, whereas\n\nS.D.M. was adjudicated neglected and dependent. Both were committed to the\n\ntemporary custody of the Agency, where they remained until trial.\n\n               In September 2024, trial commenced upon the Agency’s motion\n\nrequesting that the court grant permanent custody of S.S. to the Agency, and legal\n\n\n       2 Father of S.D.M. was a party to the case below, but did not participate in this\n\nappeal.\n\n       3 S.S. was removed in 2018, when she was left unsupervised, and Mother “failed to\n\ncomplete her case plan to effectuate reunification.” (Agency brief, p. 3.)\n\fcustody for S.D.M. to Father. The following is a summary of the evidence that was\n\npresented at trial.\n\n                                The Agency’s Case\n\n               The Agency established, by way of stipulated exhibits, that S.S. was\n\nadjudicated dependent in 2018 and placed in the legal custody of a relative. In\n\naddition, four certified copies of Mother’s recent convictions were entered into\n\nevidence, as well as several police reports. In 2023, Mother was convicted of petty\n\ntheft and resisting arrest. In 2024, Mother was convicted in three separate cases\n\nincluding: (1) disorderly conduct; (2) theft; and (3) driving under suspension and\n\nchild restraint.\n\n               Agency worker April Palidar (“April”), from Cuyahoga County\n\nChildren and Family Services, testified that she was assigned the children’s case in\n\nSeptember 2022 and that, as of the date of trial, the children had remained in the\n\nuninterrupted custody of the Agency since March 2022. She testified that the\n\npermanency plan was for reunification and that Mother was initially referred to Safe\n\nBabies Team, which helps promote speedy reunification. The case plan required\n\nthat Mother complete parenting classes, a substance-abuse assessment, and a\n\nmental-health assessment.\n\n               According to April, Mother was referred to parenting classes because\n\nshe has a history of leaving S.S. unsupervised. She testified that Mother was referred\n\nto but failed to complete several different parenting programs, until\n\nSeptember 2023, when she finally completed a parenting program at Ohio\n\fGuidestone. At the same time, Mother completed Parent/Child Psychotherapy.\n\nAlthough Mother finished these programs, April still had concerns about Mother’s\n\nfailure to work with a mental health provider on a consistent basis, as well as her\n\n“emotional outbursts” that caused her “legal issues” and troubles in her personal\n\nlife. (Tr. 21.)\n\n                  April explained that Mother was referred for a substance-abuse\n\nassessment because she used marijuana on a daily basis. April testified that Mother\n\nhad “a medical marijuana card” to help her with anxiety; however, her urine screens\n\nindicated extremely high levels of THC, which suggests that Mother is abusing\n\nmarijuana. (Tr. 22.) Nevertheless, Mother completed the assessment and no\n\ntreatment was recommended.\n\n                  According to April, Mother was referred for a mental-health\n\nassessment because she has “an extensive history of mental health issues, and the\n\nrepeated emotional outbursts and the lack of emotional control.” (Tr. 23.) April\n\ntestified that over the years Mother has spent time in several different residential\n\ntreatment facilities for her mental-health issues and has been diagnosed with post-\n\ntraumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) and anxiety. She explained that as Mother’s\n\nanxiety increases, April has witnessed Mother become uncooperative, aggressive,\n\nand threatening.\n\n                  April confirmed that for over a year Mother participated in regular\n\ncounseling through Ohio Guidestone. According to April, Mother’s counselor felt\n\nMother was doing well and the counselor had no concerns. Nevertheless, in\n\fDecember 2023, Mother stopped counseling, alleging that the provider was\n\nunavailable, and Mother was no longer benefiting from the services. Because of\n\nMother’s poor decision-making skills, April believed that Mother still needed\n\nmental-health counseling. As an example of her poor decision making, April\n\ntestified that in November 2023, while Mother had S.D.M. for an overnight visit,\n\nMother left the child with her grandfather, while Mother went shopping with a\n\nfriend. During that outing, Mother was arrested for shoplifting children’s clothing\n\nand resisting arrest.4\n\n               Thereafter, Mother was referred to four more mental health\n\nproviders; however, Mother claimed that she was unable to schedule an\n\nappointment with three of the four providers. Finally, in May 2024, Mother was\n\nreferred to People, Places & Dreams. This organization was able to provide case-\n\nmanagement services, peer support, drug-and-alcohol assessment, and a mental-\n\nhealth provider.     Nevertheless, Mother failed to attend her mental health\n\nappointments, and her case was closed with the mental health provider.\n\n               Mother was then sent to Signature Health who diagnosed her with\n\nbipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Mother started counseling and\n\nmedication through Signature Health in July 2024; however, April’s concerns\n\nremained because Mother continued to demonstrate the same uncooperative and\n\nunreasonable behavior as she did in the past.\n\n\n      4 In the midst of April’s testimony, the trial court instructed Mother to not use her\n\nphone during trial. In addition, Mother left the courtroom numerous times throughout\nthe trial.\n\f               According to April, when the case started, Mother had weekly two-\n\nhour supervised visits with the children at a county building because Mother had\n\nbeen shot in the foot while attempting to stop an argument between her sister and\n\nsome individuals. The visitations were eventually moved to a library near Mother’s\n\nhome. April testified that she had no concerns regarding Mother’s visits at that time.\n\nBy March 2023, weekly unsupervised visits began. Again, April had no concerns.\n\n               Overnight visits with the children started in June 2023 at Mother’s\n\napartment. According to April, however, Mother did not renew her lease in August\n\n2023 but did not secure new housing. So from August 2023 until November 2023,\n\nMother lived in three different places, her aunt’s, a friend’s, and then her father’s\n\ngirlfriend’s house. Overnight visitations continued through the moves until the end\n\nof November 2023 when April learned that the police had been called on Mother for\n\nallegedly stealing from her father and hitting her ten-year-old brother in the head.\n\nIt does not appear that charges were filed; however, this is also when April learned\n\nabout Mother’s latest shoplifting arrest. Due to Mother’s actions, visitations were\n\nchanged to supervised.\n\n               According to April, Mother is consistent with the weekly two-hour\n\nvisits and interacts well with the children. Mother provides food, crafts, toys, and\n\nnew clothes, with the tags still on, for the children. April testified that Mother is not\n\nworking.\n\n               April explained that the visitations remained supervised because of\n\nMother’s behavior towards April and others. During one visitation, Mother became\n\fupset with April because Mother learned that the Agency still planned to move\n\nforward with permanent custody of the children. April testified that Mother started\n\n“yelling that she was uncomfortable with [April] being there and that she didn’t want\n\n[April] there anymore.” (Tr. 50.) Mother carried on in front of her children for\n\napproximately 90 minutes before allowing April to leave with the girls. Additionally,\n\nApril testified that Mother was arrested on three separate occasions in June 2024.\n\nShe was arrested for domestic violence against her boyfriend; she was arrested for\n\ntheft; and she was arrested for menacing her elderly neighbor. April concluded that\n\nalthough Mother had completed the case plan, she did not benefit from the services\n\n“[b]ecause [Mother] continues to have these emotional outbursts. [Mother]’s been\n\nable to show small periods of stability and understanding, but it doesn’t seem to ever\n\nlast very long, so there’s still concerns[.]” (Tr. 52.)\n\n               April testified that originally both girls were in foster care together.\n\nS.S., however, was removed and placed with a relative due to aggressive behavior\n\ntowards the younger child. At the time of trial, S.S., who was 11 years old, was in\n\ncounseling and on medication for ADHD. According to April, S.S. expressed her\n\ndesire to live with her younger sister, S.D.M., but is inconsistent regarding her which\n\nadult she would prefer to live with. April indicated that she did not think Mother\n\ncould consistently meet S.S.’s needs because Mother cannot meet her own. During\n\nthe pendency of this case, S.S.’s father has not visited, established paternity, or\n\nprovided support; his whereabouts are unknown. April concluded that due to\n\fMother’s inability to control her behavior, it was in the best interest of S.S. to be\n\nplaced in the permanent custody of the Agency.\n\n              Regarding S.D.M., April testified that she is a typical three-year-old\n\nwho has been in foster care during the pendency of this case. Father has completed\n\nthe case plan, established paternity, developed a relationship with S.D.M., and\n\nobtained stable housing. April confirmed that Father and his fiancée are willing and\n\nable to provide a stable home for S.D.M., where she will live with their two minor\n\nchildren ages seven and one. April concluded that it was in the best interest of\n\nS.D.M. for Father to be awarded legal custody, as opposed to Mother who is unable\n\nto control her behavior.\n\n              On cross-examination, April acknowledged that Mother had\n\ncompleted her case plan, had appropriate housing, that the children were always\n\nhappy to see Mother, and that the children were well-bonded with Mother.\n\nNevertheless, April recommended that S.S. be placed in the permanent custody of\n\nthe Agency and S.D.M. be placed in the legal custody of Father.\n\n              The Agency called Patrolman Jamie Lee of the Garfield Heights Police\n\nDepartment (“Officer Lee”) to testify regarding his three encounters with Mother.\n\nOfficer Lee described Mother’s demeanor and actions when he arrived for a\n\ndomestic-violence call in June 2024. He indicated that Mother was hostile and\n\nuncooperative and had assaulted her boyfriend in front of officers. The second\n\nincident also happened in June 2024 and involved a neighbor dispute. When Officer\n\nLee arrived, Mother was “yelling, screaming, cussing down at her [elderly]\n\fneighbor.” (Tr. 245.) Mother refused to cooperate with police and “continued to\n\ntalk down to [Officer Lee], belittle [Officer Lee], just showed disorderly behavior\n\ntowards [Officer Lee].” (Tr. 246.) Officer Lee recommended to the prosecutor that\n\nMother be charged with menacing. The most recent encounter occurred mid-trial.\n\nOfficer Lee responded to Mother’s house for a disturbance call. When he arrived,\n\nOfficer Lee observed Mother’s hand bleeding. He learned that Mother had lost her\n\nkey and cut her hand pounding on the neighbor’s window, breaking it. Officer Lee\n\ntestified that Mother was hostile towards him and the neighbor calling them both\n\nnames.\n\n                              Mother’s Witnesses\n\n              Mother presented testimony from Danielle Mandato (“Mandato”), a\n\ncounselor from Signature Health, whom she started treatment with in July 2024.\n\nMandato testified that Mother has met with her four times virtually and that they\n\nare still in the rapport-building stage. On cross-examination, Mandato confirmed\n\nthat Mother was at least ten minutes late to two appointments that are only 30\n\nminutes in duration and that she did not attend one appointment. Mandato also\n\nconfirmed that Mother was 20 minutes late to her assessment and during the\n\nassessment, Mother was in and out of a hair salon, walking down the sidewalk, and\n\nin an Uber making it difficult to complete the assessment. She also testified that it\n\nwas out of her scope of practice to opine as to whether Mother was mentally stable\n\nenough to parent children.\n\f              Mother’s sister gave a statement to the court indicating that she was\n\nready and willing to take custody of both girls and adopt them.\n\n              Tiffany Triplett (“Triplett”), a case manager at People, Places &\n\nDreams, testified on Mother’s behalf. She indicated that she started working with\n\nMother in April 2024 and helped Mother complete her case plan. According to\n\nTriplett, she speaks with Mother on a daily basis, helping her process her emotions.\n\nTriplett testified that Mother has made progress and is calmer since starting her\n\nbipolar medications. On cross-examination, she admitted that she was unaware of\n\nthe charges Mother accumulated in June 2024.\n\n              Daneen Harrell (“Harrell”), a peer support specialist and parent\n\ncoordinator at People, Places & Dreams, testified on Mother’s behalf. Harrell\n\ntestified that she has worked with Mother for three months and speaks with Mother\n\non a daily basis, encouraging her, and teaching her a better way of life. Harrell has\n\nwitnessed approximately four visitations between Mother and the children. She\n\ntestified that Mother and the children love each other and she is a great mother.\n\nAccording to Harrell, she has had a positive impact on Mother.\n\n              D.L., the mother of Father’s middle child, testified on behalf of\n\nMother. She indicated that she has known Mother since 2019 and that she has seen\n\na positive change in Mother’s behavior over the last 18 months. She testified that\n\nMother loves her children. D.L. indicated that she would help Mother with anything\n\nshe needed if Mother is reunited with her children. D.L. testified the Father has not\n\nseen their daughter in two years, because D.L. does not feel comfortable around\n\fFather, asserting that Father is abusive to D.L. She does not, however, think Father\n\nwould hurt their daughter, nor did she press charges on Father for any alleged\n\nincidents.\n\n              Christina Joliat (“Joliat”), the children’s guardian ad litem (“GAL”),\n\ntestified on Mother’s behalf. Although Joliat recommended S.S. be placed in the\n\npermanent custody of the Agency, and S.D.M. be placed in Father’s custody, she\n\ntestified that Mother has made significant changes to her behavior over the course\n\nof this case. She stated that at the beginning of the case, it was difficult to have a\n\nfive-minute conversation with Mother, but that has changed. According to Joliat,\n\nMother has a very strong bond with the children and Joliat was hoping to reunify,\n\nbut they were “out of time.” (Tr. 257.) She stated that Mother has appropriate\n\nhousing and is compliant with her medications. Joliat testified that Mother did not\n\ncreate the issues with the providers, but rather there were issues with the providers\n\ncommunicating with the Agency. Joliat’s main concern was that S.S. is a difficult\n\nchild with mental-health issues, and Joliat is uncertain how Mother would handle\n\nher because Mother has not had extended visits since November 2023. On cross-\n\nexamination, Joliat admitted that Mother has not had overnight visits with either\n\nchild due to Mother’s poor choices and problematic behavior.\n\n              Mother testified on her own behalf. Mother stated that she was\n\nbetween jobs but had support through “programming,” so she was only responsible\n\nto pay for her phone bill and internet. (Tr. 156.) She said she was on probation for\n\ndisorderly conduct and theft. Mother testified that she completed parenting classes\n\fthrough Ohio Guidestone and learned how to communicate better with her children,\n\nand “helping me to observe like my feelings.” (Tr. 161.) Mother stated that she did\n\nnot have difficulties parenting her children. She had a medical marijuana card to\n\ncalm her nerves. Mother testified that she was satisfied with Ohio Guidestone’s\n\nservices; however, her provider’s caseload increased, and the provider stopped\n\nshowing up to Mother’s appointments, so Mother stopped services.\n\n              Mother stated that in July 2024 she started with Signature Health for\n\nher mental-health issues, and was prescribed two medications that she testified\n\n“makes me less hotheaded.” (Tr. 176.) Mother explained the incident with April,\n\nstating that she was upset with the Agency’s decision to move forward with their\n\nmotion for permanent custody. She said she thought she handled it well, because\n\nshe did not throw anything, or make the children upset. Mother, however, testified\n\nthat the children were upset.\n\n              Mother then testified that she cleared 10-12 warrants during the\n\npendency of this case in order to get her children back. She explained that she\n\nmissed one of her therapy appointments because she dropped her phone in a bucket\n\nof dishwater and did not know for five hours, and she was late to another\n\nappointment because she was in court. Mother relented that she knows people who\n\nuse drugs and have custody of their children. She asked the court for joint custody,\n\nstating, “Like I’m not beating my kids. I don’t not provide for them. Like I don’t\n\nunderstand. Like I’ve done what was asked of me. . . . Granted, I was not supposed\n\fto do that extra stuff that I did catch those cases, be with somebody that wasn’t no\n\ngood[.]” (Tr. 180.)\n\n                On cross-examination, Mother was argumentative about every topic\n\ndiscussed. Mother argued about the dates and locations of each of her numerous\n\narrests and convictions that she has had dating back to 2015. She continuously\n\ndenied responsibility for her various crimes, sometimes blaming the victims and her\n\nfriends, and other times arguing that it was in the past and was not indicative of her\n\nparenting skills. Regarding Mother’s child-endangering conviction from 2015,\n\nMother stated that she went upstairs to change clothes and S.S. went outside to play\n\nin the front yard. She said she was charged because she would not talk to police, not\n\nbecause her child was in a “predicament.” (Tr. 196.) According to S.S.’s date of birth,\n\nshe was approximately two years old at the time of the incident.5\n\n                                    Father’s Witness\n\n                Jaleesa Singleton (“Singleton”) testified on Father’s behalf. Singleton\n\nindicated that she fostered S.D.M. for the first six months, when Father was first\n\ngetting to know his daughter. Singleton testified that Father was “very invested” and\n\n“trying to do things the right way.” (Tr. 232.) Father checked in on S.D.M. nearly\n\nevery day, and S.D.M. was happy when she was around Father. Singleton had no\n\nreservations with the court granting legal custody to Father.\n\n\n\n\n       5 A certified copy of Mother’s conviction for child endangering in 2015 is part of\n\nthe record, but unclear if it was an exhibit at trial.\n\f                On September 16, 2024, the trial court issued decisions finding that\n\nit was in the best interest of the children to grant permanent custody of S.S. to the\n\nAgency and legal custody of S.D.M. to Father. Mother timely appeals, and raises two\n\nassignments of error for our review:\n\n       Assignment of Error I: The juvenile court abused its discretion\n       when it awarded legal custody of S.D.M. to Father, in violation of\n       Mother’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n       Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n       Assignment of Error II: The juvenile court erred in terminating\n       Mother’s parental rights of S.S., in violation of her rights under the\n       Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article\n       I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\n          Legal Custody to Father was Not an Abuse of Discretion\n\n                In Mother’s first assignment of error, she contends that there was\n\nlittle evidence in the record to establish that it was in S.D.M’s best interest to award\n\nlegal custody to Father instead of Mother. We disagree.\n\n                In August 2024, the Agency filed a “motion to amend dispositional\n\nprayer from ‘permanent custody’ to ‘legal custody to [Father].’”6 Legal custody is\n\ngoverned by R.C. 2151.353(A)(3), which provides that a juvenile court may award\n\nlegal custody of a child who has been adjudicated abused, neglected, or dependent\n\nto a parent, who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal\n\n\n\n\n       6 Prior to temporary custody being granted, Father had filed a motion for legal\n\ncustody of the child.\n\fcustody or is identified by a party, like the Agency, as a proposed legal custodian.\n\n“Legal custody” is\n\n      a legal status that vests in the custodian the right to have physical care\n      and control of the child and to determine where and with whom the\n      child shall live, and the right and duty to protect, train, and discipline\n      the child and to provide the child with food, shelter, education, and\n      medical care, all subject to any residual parental rights, privileges, and\n      responsibilities.\n\nR.C. 2151.011(B)(21).\n\n              When a juvenile court considers an award of legal custody following\n\nan adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency, “‘it does so by examining what\n\nwould be in the best interest of the child based on a preponderance of the evidence.’”\n\nIn re T.R., 2015-Ohio-4177, ¶ 44 (8th Dist.), quoting In re M.J.M., 2010-Ohio-1674,\n\n¶ 11, 14 (8th Dist.). A “preponderance of the evidence” means evidence that is “‘more\n\nprobable, more persuasive, or of greater value.’” In re C.V.M., 2012-Ohio-5514, ¶ 7\n\n(8th Dist.), quoting In re D.P., 2005-Ohio-5097, ¶ 52 (10th Dist.)\n\n              The decision whether to grant or deny a request for legal custody is\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the juvenile court. When reviewing a juvenile court’s\n\ndecision regarding legal custody, we apply an abuse of discretion standard. In re\n\nJ.T., 2022-Ohio-4747, ¶ 38 (8th Dist.), citing In re W.A.J., 2014-Ohio-604, ¶ 2 (8th\n\nDist.). An abuse of discretion occurs when a court exercises its judgment in an\n\nunwarranted way regarding a matter over which it has discretionary authority.\n\nJohnson v. Abdullah, 2021-Ohio-3304, ¶ 35.\n\f                “There is no ‘specific test or set of criteria’ that must be applied or\n\nconsidered when determining what is in a child’s best interest on a motion for legal\n\ncustody.” In re J.T. at ¶ 39, quoting In re T.R., 2015-Ohio-4177, ¶ 48 (8th Dist.)\n\nNevertheless, this court has held that the R.C. 2151.414(D) best-interest factors may\n\nbe “instructive” in making that determination. In re V.P., 2020-Ohio-5626, ¶ 32\n\n(8th Dist.); In re D.T., 2014-Ohio-4818, ¶ 20 (8th Dist.), citing In re E.A., 2013-\n\nOhio-1193, ¶ 13 (8th Dist.). Those factors include: (1) the interaction of the child\n\nwith the child’s parents, relatives, caregivers and any other person who may\n\nsignificantly affect the child; (2) the wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the\n\nchild or through the child’s guardian ad litem; (3) the custodial history of the child;\n\nand (4) the child’s need for a legally secure permanent placement. R.C. 2151.414(D).\n\n               Courts have also looked at the best-interest factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 3109.04(F) as a potential guide in determining what is in a child’s best interest\n\nfor the purpose of a motion for legal custody. In re J.T. at ¶ 40. Such factors include,\n\nbut are not limited to, (1) the wishes of the child’s parents regarding the child’s care;\n\n(2) the child’s interaction and interrelationships with the child’s parents, siblings,\n\nand any other person who may significantly affect the child’s best interest; (3) the\n\nchild’s adjustment to home, school, and community; (4) the mental and physical\n\nhealth of all persons involved in the situation; and (5) the extent to which court-\n\napproved visitation and companionship rights are likely to be honored and\n\nfacilitated. R.C. 3109.04(F).\n\f              Here, the evidence in the record establishes that Father complied with\n\nthe case plan, established paternity, developed a relationship with S.D.M., and had\n\nstable housing for the child. In addition, the evidence showed that the child bonded\n\nwith Father, his fiancée, and their children. Further, the GAL recommended that it\n\nwas in the best interest of S.D.M. to be placed in the legal custody of Father. The\n\nevidence also established that it is not in the child’s best interest to award legal\n\ncustody to Mother because she had not sufficiently addressed her mental-health\n\nissues that have led to multiple arrests, including domestic violence, menacing, and\n\ntheft.\n\n              After reviewing the entire record, we cannot say that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion when it awarded Father legal custody of S.D.M. Accordingly,\n\nMother’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                              Permanent Custody\n\n              In Mother’s second assignment of error, she argues that the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to terminate Mother’s parental rights and award permanent custody\n\nto the Agency for S.S. was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the\n\nevidence established that Mother remedied the concerns that led to the child’s\n\nremoval, Mother has a strong bond with S.S., and she has appropriate housing. The\n\nAgency argues that the trial court properly awarded permanent custody to the\n\nAgency under both R.C. 2151.414(B)(1) and (D)(2).\n\n              Recently, the Ohio Supreme Court reexplained the manifest-weight-\n\nof-the-evidence standard in a parental rights case as follows:\n\f      “When reviewing for manifest weight, the appellate court must weigh\n      the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of\n      the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the\n      evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a\n      manifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed and\n      a new trial ordered.” [Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2012-\n      Ohio-2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, ¶ 20.] “In weighing the evidence, the court\n      of appeals must always be mindful of the presumption in favor of the\n      finder of fact.” Id. at ¶ 21. “The underlying rationale of giving deference\n      to the findings of the trial court rests with the knowledge that the trial\n      judge is best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor,\n      gestures and voice inflections, and use these observations in weighing\n      the credibility of the proffered testimony.” Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v.\n      Cleveland, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 Ohio B. 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273\n      (1984). “‘If the evidence is susceptible of more than one construction,\n      the reviewing court is bound to give it that interpretation which is\n      consistent with the verdict and judgment, most favorable to sustaining\n      the verdict and judgment.’” Id. at fn. 3, quoting 5 Ohio Jurisprudence\n      3d, Appellate Review, Section 603, at 191-192 (1978).\n\nIn re Z.C., 2023-Ohio-4703, ¶ 14.\n\n              Initially, we recognize that the right to raise one’s own child is “an\n\n‘essential’ and ‘basic civil right.’” In re Murray, 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 156 (1990),\n\nquoting Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972); In re B.B.C., 2024-Ohio-588, ¶ 14,\n\n(8th Dist.). “Parents have a ‘fundamental liberty interest’ in the care, custody, and\n\nmanagement of the child.” Id., quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753\n\n(1982). This right, however, is not absolute. “The natural rights of a parent are\n\nalways subject to the ultimate welfare of the child, which is the polestar or\n\ncontrolling principle to be observed.” In re Cunningham, 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 106\n\n(1979), quoting In re R.J.C., 300 So.2d 54, 58 (Fla. App. 1974).\n\n              Accordingly, R.C. 2151.414(B)(1) establishes a two-part test for courts\n\nto apply when determining whether to grant a motion for permanent custody. A\n\fjuvenile court may grant a public child services agency’s motion for permanent\n\ncustody if it determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) any one of the\n\nfive factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e) exists, and (2) permanent custody\n\nis in the best interest of the children — taking into consideration the factors set forth\n\nin   R.C.   2151.414(D)(1).      We    note    that   because    the   findings   under\n\nR.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(d) are alternative findings, each is independently sufficient\n\nto establish one prong of the two-part test to grant a motion for permanent custody.\n\nIn re Dalton, 2007-Ohio-5805 (5th Dist.); In re K.C., 2024-Ohio-2081, ¶ 45 (10th\n\nDist.); In re A.J., 2024-Ohio-3291, ¶ 42 (5th Dist.).\n\n               “‘Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof\n\nwhich is more than a mere “preponderance of the evidence,” but not to the extent of\n\nsuch certainty as is required “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal cases, and\n\nwhich will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to\n\nthe facts sought to be established.’” In re Z.C. at ¶ 7, quoting Cross v. Ledford, 161\n\nOhio St. 469 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n               Applicable to the case at hand is the factor set forth in\n\nR.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), which states that the child has been in the temporary custody\n\nof one or more public children services agencies for 12 or more months of a\n\nconsecutive 22-month period. The record in this case reflects that S.S. was placed\n\nin emergency custody of the Agency on March 16, 2022; thereafter S.S. was\n\nadjudicated abused and neglected and placed in the temporary custody of the\n\nAgency. At the time the motion for permanent custody was filed, January 26, 2024,\n\fthe child had been in Agency custody for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-\n\nmonth period satisfying R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d).\n\n                 Having determined that the Agency established that S.S. has been in\n\nthe custody of the Agency for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period,\n\nwe turn to Mother’s argument that she has remedied the concern’s that led to S.S.’s\n\nremoval and that it was not in the child’s best interest to award permanent custody\n\nto the Agency.\n\n                 R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) requires that the juvenile court consider all\n\nrelevant factors in determining whether the children’s best interests would be served\n\nby granting the permanent-custody motion.           These factors include (a) the\n\ninteraction and interrelationship of the child with the child’s parents, siblings,\n\nrelatives, foster caregivers, and out-of-home providers; (b) the child’s wishes, as\n\nexpressed directly by the child or through the child’s guardian ad litem; (c) the\n\nchild’s custodial history; (d) the child’s need for a legally secured permanent\n\nplacement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency; and (e) whether any of the factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 2151.414(E)(7)-(11) apply. R.C. 2151.414(D)(1). A juvenile court must consider\n\neach of the R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors when making a permanent custody\n\ndetermination, but no one factor is given greater weight than the others. In re\n\nSchaefer, 2006-Ohio-5513, ¶ 56.          Only one of the factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 2151.414(D)(1) needs to be resolved in favor of permanent custody. In re D.H.,\n\f2022-Ohio-2780, ¶ 46 (8th Dist.), citing In re G.W., 2019-Ohio-1533, ¶ 72 (8th\n\nDist.).\n\n                  In the instant case, the record reflects that the juvenile court\n\nconsidered all of the evidence and arguments of counsel and determined that the\n\nAgency proved by clear and convincing evidence that permanent custody was in the\n\nbest interest of S.S. The court reasoned that S.S. had not been in Mother’s custody\n\nsince 2018, and S.S. has resided with her maternal aunt since 2022, who has\n\nexpressed interest in adopting S.S. The trial court noted that the GAL recommended\n\npermanent custody to the Agency, and that the father had abandoned the child.\n\nFurther, the trial court conducted an in camera interview with S.S. and considered\n\nher wishes, when finding that reunification was not in the best interest of the child.\n\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we cannot say the juvenile court lost its way when\n\nit granted the Agency’s motion for permanent custody under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1).\n\n                  Even though it was not required in this case, the trial court set forth\n\n“an additional basis for granting permanent custody” under R.C. 2151.414(D)(2).\n\n(J.E., Sept. 16, 2024, R. 377.) R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) dictates that permanent custody\n\nis in the best interest of the child and the court is required to commit the child to the\n\npermanent custody of a public children services agency when all of the following\n\napply:\n\n          (a) The court determines by clear and convincing evidence that one or\n          more of the factors in division (E) of this section exist and the child\n          cannot be placed with one of the child’s parents within a reasonable\n          time or should not be placed with either parent.\n\f      (b) The child has been in an agency’s custody for two years or longer\n      and no longer qualifies for temporary custody pursuant to division (D)\n      of section 2151.415 of the Revised Code.\n\n      (c) The child does not meet the requirements for a planned permanent\n      living arrangement pursuant to division (A)(5) of section 2151.353 of\n      the Revised Code.\n\n      (d) Prior to the dispositional hearing, no relative or other interested\n      person has filed, or has been identified in, a motion for legal custody of\n      the child.\n\n               Here, the trial court made the findings under (a)-(d) of\n\nR.C. 2151.414(D)(2). The court determined that S.S. was in the Agency’s custody for\n\nmore than two years and no longer qualified for temporary custody. In addition,\n\nS.S. did not meet the requirements for a planned permanent living arrangement,\n\nand no relative or other interested person had filed a motion for legal custody prior\n\nto trial. Finally, the trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that five of\n\nthe factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(E) applied in this case, including:\n\n      (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child’s home and\n      notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the\n      agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially\n      caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed\n      continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions\n      causing the child to be placed outside the child’s home. In determining\n      whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the\n      court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric,\n      psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material\n      resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of\n      changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain\n      parental duties.\n\n      (2) Chronic mental illness, chronic emotional illness, intellectual\n      disability, physical disability, or chemical dependency of the parent\n      that is so severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate\n      permanent home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated,\n      within one year after the court holds the hearing pursuant to division\n\f(A) of this section or for the purposes of division (A)(4) of section\n2151.353 of the Revised Code;\n\n...\n\n(4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the\nchild by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the\nchild when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness\nto provide an adequate permanent home for the child[.]\n\n...\n\n(10) The parent [father] has abandoned the child.\n\n...\n\n(16) Any other factor the court considers relevant.\n\n        The trial court reasoned that\n\n[Mother] has not benefitted from [the case plan] services sufficiently to\nbe reunified with the child. This was shown by a lack of consistency\nwith providers, [Mother]’s emotional outbursts, and repeated arrests\nand police involvement including three days ago after the first full day\nof trial.\n\n[Mother] has an extensive history of mental health issues that interfere\nwith her daily life. [Mother] lost unsupervised visits in November of\n2023, and stopped working with Ohio Guidestone in December of\n2023. No mental health services were started again until July of 2024\ndespite several referrals which includes Caritas, Care Alliance, Murtis\nTaylor and The Centers. In July of 2024, [Mother] started services with\nSignature Health. Her counselor, who testified as a witness called by\n[Mother] stated that they were just in the process of setting treatment\ngoals, that [Mother] had attended four of the five on-line thirty-minute\nsessions and had been at least ten minutes late to two of them.\n\nThe Mother’s behavior was described [by] both witnesses for the\nagency and the GAL as aggressive. While Mother may have made\nprogress in addressing her communication skills, the testimony,\nevidence and her courtroom behavior are clear and convincing\nevidence that the child’s stability would be at a severe risk if reunified\nwith her. There was testimony about an incident in August of 2022\nwhere the Mother was shot during an argument. Arguments involving\n\f      the Mother and multiple other people during visits and outside of visits\n      over the entire course of this case demonstrate a pervasive pattern.\n\n(J.E., Sept. 16, 2024, R. 377.)\n\n                 We note that the court is only required to find one of the\n\nR.C. 2151.414(E) factors present to enter a finding that a child cannot or should be\n\nplaced with a parent. In re D.H., 2022-Ohio-2780, ¶ 29, citing In re L.W., 2019-\n\nOhio-1343 (8th Dist.). Here, the court made five. According to R.C. 2151.414(E), if\n\nthe court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that one or more of the\n\n(E)(1)-(16) factors exist, the court shall enter a finding that the child cannot be\n\nplaced with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with\n\neither parent.     Because the trial court found five of the factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 2151.414(E) applied in S.S.’s case, it correctly found that S.S. cannot or should\n\nnot be placed with either parent. Furthermore, the trial court fittingly acknowledged\n\nthat “[t]he issue before the court is the child’s best interest, not the Mother’s\n\nprogress. . . . None of the witnesses who testified in Mother’s case addressed the\n\nchild’s best interest[.]” (J.E., Sept. 16, 2024, R. 377.)\n\n                 After reviewing the entire record, we cannot say that the juvenile\n\ncourt’s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence when it granted the\n\nAgency’s motion for permanent custody of S.S. and terminated Mother’s parental\n\nrights. Accordingly, Mother’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                 Judgments affirmed.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\f      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court, juvenile division, to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nMARY J.

BOYLE, J.:\n\n                   This appeal involves a child-protection matter involving two minor\n\nchildren before the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court in Case Nos. AD22902694 and\n\nAD22902695.1 Y.M., (“Mother”), appeals the decisions of the trial court granting\n\n\n        1 Because the filings in both cases are nearly identical, citations to the record will\n\nbe to Case No. AD22902694, unless a more specific citation is warranted.\n\flegal custody of S.D.M. to Father2 and permanent custody of S.S. to plaintiff-\n\nappellee, Cuyahoga County Division of Children and Family Services (“the Agency”).\n\nAfter careful review of the record, we affirm.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\n               On March 15, 2022, Mother’s two children, S.S. (nine-years-old) and\n\nS.D.M. (one-year-old) were removed from Mother’s care after law enforcement\n\nresponded to Mother’s home and found the children alone. S.S. had been in the legal\n\ncustody of a relative since her removal in 2018 and was visiting Mother that day.3\n\n               On March 16, 2022, the Agency filed a complaint for neglect, abuse\n\n(S.S.), dependency (S.D.M.) and temporary custody, as well as a motion for pre-\n\ndispositional temporary custody. That same day emergency custody was granted to\n\nthe Agency for both children. A case plan was developed and implemented in an\n\nattempt to reunify the children with Mother. S.D.M.’s Father participated at the\n\ntrial-court level, while S.S.’s father did not.\n\n               In August 2022, S.S. was adjudicated abused and neglected, whereas\n\nS.D.M. was adjudicated neglected and dependent. Both were committed to the\n\ntemporary custody of the Agency, where they remained until trial.\n\n               In September 2024, trial commenced upon the Agency’s motion\n\nrequesting that the court grant permanent custody of S.S. to the Agency, and legal\n\n\n       2 Father of S.D.M. was a party to the case below, but did not participate in this\n\nappeal.\n\n       3 S.S. was removed in 2018, when she was left unsupervised, and Mother “failed to\n\ncomplete her case plan to effectuate reunification.” (Agency brief, p. 3.)\n\fcustody for S.D.M. to Father. The following is a summary of the evidence that was\n\npresented at trial.\n\n                                The Agency’s Case\n\n               The Agency established, by way of stipulated exhibits, that S.S. was\n\nadjudicated dependent in 2018 and placed in the legal custody of a relative. In\n\naddition, four certified copies of Mother’s recent convictions were entered into\n\nevidence, as well as several police reports. In 2023, Mother was convicted of petty\n\ntheft and resisting arrest. In 2024, Mother was convicted in three separate cases\n\nincluding: (1) disorderly conduct; (2) theft; and (3) driving under suspension and\n\nchild restraint.\n\n               Agency worker April Palidar (“April”), from Cuyahoga County\n\nChildren and Family Services, testified that she was assigned the children’s case in\n\nSeptember 2022 and that, as of the date of trial, the children had remained in the\n\nuninterrupted custody of the Agency since March 2022. She testified that the\n\npermanency plan was for reunification and that Mother was initially referred to Safe\n\nBabies Team, which helps promote speedy reunification. The case plan required\n\nthat Mother complete parenting classes, a substance-abuse assessment, and a\n\nmental-health assessment.\n\n               According to April, Mother was referred to parenting classes because\n\nshe has a history of leaving S.S. unsupervised. She testified that Mother was referred\n\nto but failed to complete several different parenting programs, until\n\nSeptember 2023, when she finally completed a parenting program at Ohio\n\fGuidestone. At the same time, Mother completed Parent/Child Psychotherapy.\n\nAlthough Mother finished these programs, April still had concerns about Mother’s\n\nfailure to work with a mental health provider on a consistent basis, as well as her\n\n“emotional outbursts” that caused her “legal issues” and troubles in her personal\n\nlife. (Tr. 21.)\n\n                  April explained that Mother was referred for a substance-abuse\n\nassessment because she used marijuana on a daily basis. April testified that Mother\n\nhad “a medical marijuana card” to help her with anxiety; however, her urine screens\n\nindicated extremely high levels of THC, which suggests that Mother is abusing\n\nmarijuana. (Tr. 22.) Nevertheless, Mother completed the assessment and no\n\ntreatment was recommended.\n\n                  According to April, Mother was referred for a mental-health\n\nassessment because she has “an extensive history of mental health issues, and the\n\nrepeated emotional outbursts and the lack of emotional control.” (Tr. 23.) April\n\ntestified that over the years Mother has spent time in several different residential\n\ntreatment facilities for her mental-health issues and has been diagnosed with post-\n\ntraumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) and anxiety. She explained that as Mother’s\n\nanxiety increases, April has witnessed Mother become uncooperative, aggressive,\n\nand threatening.\n\n                  April confirmed that for over a year Mother participated in regular\n\ncounseling through Ohio Guidestone. According to April, Mother’s counselor felt\n\nMother was doing well and the counselor had no concerns. Nevertheless, in\n\fDecember 2023, Mother stopped counseling, alleging that the provider was\n\nunavailable, and Mother was no longer benefiting from the services. Because of\n\nMother’s poor decision-making skills, April believed that Mother still needed\n\nmental-health counseling. As an example of her poor decision making, April\n\ntestified that in November 2023, while Mother had S.D.M. for an overnight visit,\n\nMother left the child with her grandfather, while Mother went shopping with a\n\nfriend. During that outing, Mother was arrested for shoplifting children’s clothing\n\nand resisting arrest.4\n\n               Thereafter, Mother was referred to four more mental health\n\nproviders; however, Mother claimed that she was unable to schedule an\n\nappointment with three of the four providers. Finally, in May 2024, Mother was\n\nreferred to People, Places &amp; Dreams. This organization was able to provide case-\n\nmanagement services, peer support, drug-and-alcohol assessment, and a mental-\n\nhealth provider.     Nevertheless, Mother failed to attend her mental health\n\nappointments, and her case was closed with the mental health provider.\n\n               Mother was then sent to Signature Health who diagnosed her with\n\nbipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Mother started counseling and\n\nmedication through Signature Health in July 2024; however, April’s concerns\n\nremained because Mother continued to demonstrate the same uncooperative and\n\nunreasonable behavior as she did in the past.\n\n\n      4 In the midst of April’s testimony, the trial court instructed Mother to not use her\n\nphone during trial. In addition, Mother left the courtroom numerous times throughout\nthe trial.\n\f               According to April, when the case started, Mother had weekly two-\n\nhour supervised visits with the children at a county building because Mother had\n\nbeen shot in the foot while attempting to stop an argument between her sister and\n\nsome individuals. The visitations were eventually moved to a library near Mother’s\n\nhome. April testified that she had no concerns regarding Mother’s visits at that time.\n\nBy March 2023, weekly unsupervised visits began. Again, April had no concerns.\n\n               Overnight visits with the children started in June 2023 at Mother’s\n\napartment. According to April, however, Mother did not renew her lease in August\n\n2023 but did not secure new housing. So from August 2023 until November 2023,\n\nMother lived in three different places, her aunt’s, a friend’s, and then her father’s\n\ngirlfriend’s house. Overnight visitations continued through the moves until the end\n\nof November 2023 when April learned that the police had been called on Mother for\n\nallegedly stealing from her father and hitting her ten-year-old brother in the head.\n\nIt does not appear that charges were filed; however, this is also when April learned\n\nabout Mother’s latest shoplifting arrest. Due to Mother’s actions, visitations were\n\nchanged to supervised.\n\n               According to April, Mother is consistent with the weekly two-hour\n\nvisits and interacts well with the children. Mother provides food, crafts, toys, and\n\nnew clothes, with the tags still on, for the children. April testified that Mother is not\n\nworking.\n\n               April explained that the visitations remained supervised because of\n\nMother’s behavior towards April and others. During one visitation, Mother became\n\fupset with April because Mother learned that the Agency still planned to move\n\nforward with permanent custody of the children. April testified that Mother started\n\n“yelling that she was uncomfortable with [April] being there and that she didn’t want\n\n[April] there anymore.” (Tr. 50.) Mother carried on in front of her children for\n\napproximately 90 minutes before allowing April to leave with the girls. Additionally,\n\nApril testified that Mother was arrested on three separate occasions in June 2024.\n\nShe was arrested for domestic violence against her boyfriend; she was arrested for\n\ntheft; and she was arrested for menacing her elderly neighbor. April concluded that\n\nalthough Mother had completed the case plan, she did not benefit from the services\n\n“[b]ecause [Mother] continues to have these emotional outbursts. [Mother]’s been\n\nable to show small periods of stability and understanding, but it doesn’t seem to ever\n\nlast very long, so there’s still concerns[.]” (Tr. 52.)\n\n               April testified that originally both girls were in foster care together.\n\nS.S., however, was removed and placed with a relative due to aggressive behavior\n\ntowards the younger child. At the time of trial, S.S., who was 11 years old, was in\n\ncounseling and on medication for ADHD. According to April, S.S. expressed her\n\ndesire to live with her younger sister, S.D.M., but is inconsistent regarding her which\n\nadult she would prefer to live with. April indicated that she did not think Mother\n\ncould consistently meet S.S.’s needs because Mother cannot meet her own. During\n\nthe pendency of this case, S.S.’s father has not visited, established paternity, or\n\nprovided support; his whereabouts are unknown. April concluded that due to\n\fMother’s inability to control her behavior, it was in the best interest of S.S. to be\n\nplaced in the permanent custody of the Agency.\n\n              Regarding S.D.M., April testified that she is a typical three-year-old\n\nwho has been in foster care during the pendency of this case. Father has completed\n\nthe case plan, established paternity, developed a relationship with S.D.M., and\n\nobtained stable housing. April confirmed that Father and his fiancée are willing and\n\nable to provide a stable home for S.D.M., where she will live with their two minor\n\nchildren ages seven and one. April concluded that it was in the best interest of\n\nS.D.M. for Father to be awarded legal custody, as opposed to Mother who is unable\n\nto control her behavior.\n\n              On cross-examination, April acknowledged that Mother had\n\ncompleted her case plan, had appropriate housing, that the children were always\n\nhappy to see Mother, and that the children were well-bonded with Mother.\n\nNevertheless, April recommended that S.S. be placed in the permanent custody of\n\nthe Agency and S.D.M. be placed in the legal custody of Father.\n\n              The Agency called Patrolman Jamie Lee of the Garfield Heights Police\n\nDepartment (“Officer Lee”) to testify regarding his three encounters with Mother.\n\nOfficer Lee described Mother’s demeanor and actions when he arrived for a\n\ndomestic-violence call in June 2024. He indicated that Mother was hostile and\n\nuncooperative and had assaulted her boyfriend in front of officers. The second\n\nincident also happened in June 2024 and involved a neighbor dispute. When Officer\n\nLee arrived, Mother was “yelling, screaming, cussing down at her [elderly]\n\fneighbor.” (Tr. 245.) Mother refused to cooperate with police and “continued to\n\ntalk down to [Officer Lee], belittle [Officer Lee], just showed disorderly behavior\n\ntowards [Officer Lee].” (Tr. 246.) Officer Lee recommended to the prosecutor that\n\nMother be charged with menacing. The most recent encounter occurred mid-trial.\n\nOfficer Lee responded to Mother’s house for a disturbance call. When he arrived,\n\nOfficer Lee observed Mother’s hand bleeding. He learned that Mother had lost her\n\nkey and cut her hand pounding on the neighbor’s window, breaking it. Officer Lee\n\ntestified that Mother was hostile towards him and the neighbor calling them both\n\nnames.\n\n                              Mother’s Witnesses\n\n              Mother presented testimony from Danielle Mandato (“Mandato”), a\n\ncounselor from Signature Health, whom she started treatment with in July 2024.\n\nMandato testified that Mother has met with her four times virtually and that they\n\nare still in the rapport-building stage. On cross-examination, Mandato confirmed\n\nthat Mother was at least ten minutes late to two appointments that are only 30\n\nminutes in duration and that she did not attend one appointment. Mandato also\n\nconfirmed that Mother was 20 minutes late to her assessment and during the\n\nassessment, Mother was in and out of a hair salon, walking down the sidewalk, and\n\nin an Uber making it difficult to complete the assessment. She also testified that it\n\nwas out of her scope of practice to opine as to whether Mother was mentally stable\n\nenough to parent children.\n\f              Mother’s sister gave a statement to the court indicating that she was\n\nready and willing to take custody of both girls and adopt them.\n\n              Tiffany Triplett (“Triplett”), a case manager at People, Places &amp;\n\nDreams, testified on Mother’s behalf. She indicated that she started working with\n\nMother in April 2024 and helped Mother complete her case plan. According to\n\nTriplett, she speaks with Mother on a daily basis, helping her process her emotions.\n\nTriplett testified that Mother has made progress and is calmer since starting her\n\nbipolar medications. On cross-examination, she admitted that she was unaware of\n\nthe charges Mother accumulated in June 2024.\n\n              Daneen Harrell (“Harrell”), a peer support specialist and parent\n\ncoordinator at People, Places &amp; Dreams, testified on Mother’s behalf. Harrell\n\ntestified that she has worked with Mother for three months and speaks with Mother\n\non a daily basis, encouraging her, and teaching her a better way of life. Harrell has\n\nwitnessed approximately four visitations between Mother and the children. She\n\ntestified that Mother and the children love each other and she is a great mother.\n\nAccording to Harrell, she has had a positive impact on Mother.\n\n              D.L., the mother of Father’s middle child, testified on behalf of\n\nMother. She indicated that she has known Mother since 2019 and that she has seen\n\na positive change in Mother’s behavior over the last 18 months. She testified that\n\nMother loves her children. D.L. indicated that she would help Mother with anything\n\nshe needed if Mother is reunited with her children. D.L. testified the Father has not\n\nseen their daughter in two years, because D.L. does not feel comfortable around\n\fFather, asserting that Father is abusive to D.L. She does not, however, think Father\n\nwould hurt their daughter, nor did she press charges on Father for any alleged\n\nincidents.\n\n              Christina Joliat (“Joliat”), the children’s guardian ad litem (“GAL”),\n\ntestified on Mother’s behalf. Although Joliat recommended S.S. be placed in the\n\npermanent custody of the Agency, and S.D.M. be placed in Father’s custody, she\n\ntestified that Mother has made significant changes to her behavior over the course\n\nof this case. She stated that at the beginning of the case, it was difficult to have a\n\nfive-minute conversation with Mother, but that has changed. According to Joliat,\n\nMother has a very strong bond with the children and Joliat was hoping to reunify,\n\nbut they were “out of time.” (Tr. 257.) She stated that Mother has appropriate\n\nhousing and is compliant with her medications. Joliat testified that Mother did not\n\ncreate the issues with the providers, but rather there were issues with the providers\n\ncommunicating with the Agency. Joliat’s main concern was that S.S. is a difficult\n\nchild with mental-health issues, and Joliat is uncertain how Mother would handle\n\nher because Mother has not had extended visits since November 2023. On cross-\n\nexamination, Joliat admitted that Mother has not had overnight visits with either\n\nchild due to Mother’s poor choices and problematic behavior.\n\n              Mother testified on her own behalf. Mother stated that she was\n\nbetween jobs but had support through “programming,” so she was only responsible\n\nto pay for her phone bill and internet. (Tr. 156.) She said she was on probation for\n\ndisorderly conduct and theft. Mother testified that she completed parenting classes\n\fthrough Ohio Guidestone and learned how to communicate better with her children,\n\nand “helping me to observe like my feelings.” (Tr. 161.) Mother stated that she did\n\nnot have difficulties parenting her children. She had a medical marijuana card to\n\ncalm her nerves. Mother testified that she was satisfied with Ohio Guidestone’s\n\nservices; however, her provider’s caseload increased, and the provider stopped\n\nshowing up to Mother’s appointments, so Mother stopped services.\n\n              Mother stated that in July 2024 she started with Signature Health for\n\nher mental-health issues, and was prescribed two medications that she testified\n\n“makes me less hotheaded.” (Tr. 176.) Mother explained the incident with April,\n\nstating that she was upset with the Agency’s decision to move forward with their\n\nmotion for permanent custody. She said she thought she handled it well, because\n\nshe did not throw anything, or make the children upset. Mother, however, testified\n\nthat the children were upset.\n\n              Mother then testified that she cleared 10-12 warrants during the\n\npendency of this case in order to get her children back. She explained that she\n\nmissed one of her therapy appointments because she dropped her phone in a bucket\n\nof dishwater and did not know for five hours, and she was late to another\n\nappointment because she was in court. Mother relented that she knows people who\n\nuse drugs and have custody of their children. She asked the court for joint custody,\n\nstating, “Like I’m not beating my kids. I don’t not provide for them. Like I don’t\n\nunderstand. Like I’ve done what was asked of me. . . . Granted, I was not supposed\n\fto do that extra stuff that I did catch those cases, be with somebody that wasn’t no\n\ngood[.]” (Tr. 180.)\n\n                On cross-examination, Mother was argumentative about every topic\n\ndiscussed. Mother argued about the dates and locations of each of her numerous\n\narrests and convictions that she has had dating back to 2015. She continuously\n\ndenied responsibility for her various crimes, sometimes blaming the victims and her\n\nfriends, and other times arguing that it was in the past and was not indicative of her\n\nparenting skills. Regarding Mother’s child-endangering conviction from 2015,\n\nMother stated that she went upstairs to change clothes and S.S. went outside to play\n\nin the front yard. She said she was charged because she would not talk to police, not\n\nbecause her child was in a “predicament.” (Tr. 196.) According to S.S.’s date of birth,\n\nshe was approximately two years old at the time of the incident.5\n\n                                    Father’s Witness\n\n                Jaleesa Singleton (“Singleton”) testified on Father’s behalf. Singleton\n\nindicated that she fostered S.D.M. for the first six months, when Father was first\n\ngetting to know his daughter. Singleton testified that Father was “very invested” and\n\n“trying to do things the right way.” (Tr. 232.) Father checked in on S.D.M. nearly\n\nevery day, and S.D.M. was happy when she was around Father. Singleton had no\n\nreservations with the court granting legal custody to Father.\n\n\n\n\n       5 A certified copy of Mother’s conviction for child endangering in 2015 is part of\n\nthe record, but unclear if it was an exhibit at trial.\n\f                On September 16, 2024, the trial court issued decisions finding that\n\nit was in the best interest of the children to grant permanent custody of S.S. to the\n\nAgency and legal custody of S.D.M. to Father. Mother timely appeals, and raises two\n\nassignments of error for our review:\n\n       Assignment of Error I: The juvenile court abused its discretion\n       when it awarded legal custody of S.D.M. to Father, in violation of\n       Mother’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n       Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n       Assignment of Error II: The juvenile court erred in terminating\n       Mother’s parental rights of S.S., in violation of her rights under the\n       Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article\n       I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\n          Legal Custody to Father was Not an Abuse of Discretion\n\n                In Mother’s first assignment of error, she contends that there was\n\nlittle evidence in the record to establish that it was in S.D.M’s best interest to award\n\nlegal custody to Father instead of Mother. We disagree.\n\n                In August 2024, the Agency filed a “motion to amend dispositional\n\nprayer from ‘permanent custody’ to ‘legal custody to [Father].’”6 Legal custody is\n\ngoverned by R.C. 2151.353(A)(3), which provides that a juvenile court may award\n\nlegal custody of a child who has been adjudicated abused, neglected, or dependent\n\nto a parent, who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal\n\n\n\n\n       6 Prior to temporary custody being granted, Father had filed a motion for legal\n\ncustody of the child.\n\fcustody or is identified by a party, like the Agency, as a proposed legal custodian.\n\n“Legal custody” is\n\n      a legal status that vests in the custodian the right to have physical care\n      and control of the child and to determine where and with whom the\n      child shall live, and the right and duty to protect, train, and discipline\n      the child and to provide the child with food, shelter, education, and\n      medical care, all subject to any residual parental rights, privileges, and\n      responsibilities.\n\nR.C. 2151.011(B)(21).\n\n              When a juvenile court considers an award of legal custody following\n\nan adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency, “‘it does so by examining what\n\nwould be in the best interest of the child based on a preponderance of the evidence.’”\n\nIn re T.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3008792\"><a href=\"/opinion/3008792/in-re-tr/#44\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re T.R.\">2015-Ohio-4177, ¶ 44</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Dist.), quoting In re M.J.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2010-Ohio-1674</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n¶ 11, 14 (8th Dist.).

Those factors include: (1) the interaction of the child\n\nwith the child’s parents, relatives, caregivers and any other person who may\n\nsignificantly affect the child; (2) the wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the\n\nchild or through the child’s guardian ad litem; (3) the custodial history of the child;\n\nand (4) the child’s need for a legally secure permanent placement. R.C. 2151.414(D).\n\n               Courts have also looked at the best-interest factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 3109.04(F) as a potential guide in determining what is in a child’s best interest\n\nfor the purpose of a motion for legal custody. In re J.T. at ¶ 40. Such factors include,\n\nbut are not limited to, (1) the wishes of the child’s parents regarding the child’s care;\n\n(2) the child’s interaction and interrelationships with the child’s parents, siblings,\n\nand any other person who may significantly affect the child’s best interest; (3) the\n\nchild’s adjustment to home, school, and community; (4) the mental and physical\n\nhealth of all persons involved in the situation; and (5) the extent to which court-\n\napproved visitation and companionship rights are likely to be honored and\n\nfacilitated. R.C. 3109.04(F).\n\f              Here, the evidence in the record establishes that Father complied with\n\nthe case plan, established paternity, developed a relationship with S.D.M., and had\n\nstable housing for the child. In addition, the evidence showed that the child bonded\n\nwith Father, his fiancée, and their children. Further, the GAL recommended that it\n\nwas in the best interest of S.D.M. to be placed in the legal custody of Father. The\n\nevidence also established that it is not in the child’s best interest to award legal\n\ncustody to Mother because she had not sufficiently addressed her mental-health\n\nissues that have led to multiple arrests, including domestic violence, menacing, and\n\ntheft.\n\n              After reviewing the entire record, we cannot say that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion when it awarded Father legal custody of S.D.M. Accordingly,\n\nMother’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                              Permanent Custody\n\n              In Mother’s second assignment of error, she argues that the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to terminate Mother’s parental rights and award permanent custody\n\nto the Agency for S.S. was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the\n\nevidence established that Mother remedied the concerns that led to the child’s\n\nremoval, Mother has a strong bond with S.S., and she has appropriate housing. The\n\nAgency argues that the trial court properly awarded permanent custody to the\n\nAgency under both R.C. 2151.414(B)(1) and (D)(2).\n\n              Recently, the Ohio Supreme Court reexplained the manifest-weight-\n\nof-the-evidence standard in a parental rights case as follows:\n\f      “When reviewing for manifest weight, the appellate court must weigh\n      the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of\n      the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the\n      evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a\n      manifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed and\n      a new trial ordered.” [Eastley v.

A\n\fjuvenile court may grant a public child services agency’s motion for permanent\n\ncustody if it determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) any one of the\n\nfive factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e) exists, and (2) permanent custody\n\nis in the best interest of the children — taking into consideration the factors set forth\n\nin   R.C.   2151.414(D)(1).      We    note    that   because    the   findings   under\n\nR.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(d) are alternative findings, each is independently sufficient\n\nto establish one prong of the two-part test to grant a motion for permanent custody.\n\nIn re Dalton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3771671\"><a href=\"/opinion/4016186/in-re-dalton-2007-ap-0041-10-24-2007/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In Re Dalton, 2007 Ap 0041 (10-24-2007)\">2007-Ohio-5805</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Dist.); In re K.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9975722\"><a href=\"/opinion/9509109/in-re-kc/#45\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re K.C.\">2024-Ohio-2081, ¶ 45</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th\n\nDist.); In re A.J., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"10557946\"><a href=\"/opinion/10091346/in-re-aj/#42\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re A.J.\">2024-Ohio-3291, ¶ 42</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Dist.).\n\n               “‘Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof\n\nwhich is more than a mere “preponderance of the evidence,” but not to the extent of\n\nsuch certainty as is required “beyond a reasonable doubt” in criminal cases, and\n\nwhich will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to\n\nthe facts sought to be established.’” In re Z.C. at ¶ 7, quoting Cross v.

The record in this case reflects that S.S. was placed\n\nin emergency custody of the Agency on March 16, 2022; thereafter S.S. was\n\nadjudicated abused and neglected and placed in the temporary custody of the\n\nAgency. At the time the motion for permanent custody was filed, January 26, 2024,\n\fthe child had been in Agency custody for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-\n\nmonth period satisfying R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d).\n\n                 Having determined that the Agency established that S.S. has been in\n\nthe custody of the Agency for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period,\n\nwe turn to Mother’s argument that she has remedied the concern’s that led to S.S.’s\n\nremoval and that it was not in the child’s best interest to award permanent custody\n\nto the Agency.\n\n                 R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) requires that the juvenile court consider all\n\nrelevant factors in determining whether the children’s best interests would be served\n\nby granting the permanent-custody motion.           These factors include (a) the\n\ninteraction and interrelationship of the child with the child’s parents, siblings,\n\nrelatives, foster caregivers, and out-of-home providers; (b) the child’s wishes, as\n\nexpressed directly by the child or through the child’s guardian ad litem; (c) the\n\nchild’s custodial history; (d) the child’s need for a legally secured permanent\n\nplacement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency; and (e) whether any of the factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 2151.414(E)(7)-(11) apply. R.C. 2151.414(D)(1). A juvenile court must consider\n\neach of the R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors when making a permanent custody\n\ndetermination, but no one factor is given greater weight than the others.

The court reasoned that S.S. had not been in Mother’s custody\n\nsince 2018, and S.S. has resided with her maternal aunt since 2022, who has\n\nexpressed interest in adopting S.S. The trial court noted that the GAL recommended\n\npermanent custody to the Agency, and that the father had abandoned the child.\n\nFurther, the trial court conducted an in camera interview with S.S. and considered\n\nher wishes, when finding that reunification was not in the best interest of the child.\n\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we cannot say the juvenile court lost its way when\n\nit granted the Agency’s motion for permanent custody under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1).\n\n                  Even though it was not required in this case, the trial court set forth\n\n“an additional basis for granting permanent custody” under R.C. 2151.414(D)(2).\n\n(J.E., Sept. 16, 2024, R. 377.) R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) dictates that permanent custody\n\nis in the best interest of the child and the court is required to commit the child to the\n\npermanent custody of a public children services agency when all of the following\n\napply:\n\n          (a) The court determines by clear and convincing evidence that one or\n          more of the factors in division (E) of this section exist and the child\n          cannot be placed with one of the child’s parents within a reasonable\n          time or should not be placed with either parent.\n\f      (b) The child has been in an agency’s custody for two years or longer\n      and no longer qualifies for temporary custody pursuant to division (D)\n      of section 2151.415 of the Revised Code.\n\n      (c) The child does not meet the requirements for a planned permanent\n      living arrangement pursuant to division (A)(5) of section 2151.353 of\n      the Revised Code.\n\n      (d) Prior to the dispositional hearing, no relative or other interested\n      person has filed, or has been identified in, a motion for legal custody of\n      the child.\n\n               Here, the trial court made the findings under (a)-(d) of\n\nR.C. 2151.414(D)(2). The court determined that S.S. was in the Agency’s custody for\n\nmore than two years and no longer qualified for temporary custody. In addition,\n\nS.S. did not meet the requirements for a planned permanent living arrangement,\n\nand no relative or other interested person had filed a motion for legal custody prior\n\nto trial. Finally, the trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that five of\n\nthe factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(E) applied in this case, including:\n\n      (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child’s home and\n      notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the\n      agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially\n      caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed\n      continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions\n      causing the child to be placed outside the child’s home. In determining\n      whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the\n      court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric,\n      psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material\n      resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of\n      changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain\n      parental duties.\n\n      (2) Chronic mental illness, chronic emotional illness, intellectual\n      disability, physical disability, or chemical dependency of the parent\n      that is so severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate\n      permanent home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated,\n      within one year after the court holds the hearing pursuant to division\n\f(A) of this section or for the purposes of division (A)(4) of section\n2151.353 of the Revised Code;\n\n...\n\n(4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the\nchild by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the\nchild when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness\nto provide an adequate permanent home for the child[.]\n\n...\n\n(10) The parent [father] has abandoned the child.\n\n...\n\n(16) Any other factor the court considers relevant.\n\n        The trial court reasoned that\n\n[Mother] has not benefitted from [the case plan] services sufficiently to\nbe reunified with the child. This was shown by a lack of consistency\nwith providers, [Mother]’s emotional outbursts, and repeated arrests\nand police involvement including three days ago after the first full day\nof trial.\n\n[Mother] has an extensive history of mental health issues that interfere\nwith her daily life. [Mother] lost unsupervised visits in November of\n2023, and stopped working with Ohio Guidestone in December of\n2023. No mental health services were started again until July of 2024\ndespite several referrals which includes Caritas, Care Alliance, Murtis\nTaylor and The Centers. In July of 2024, [Mother] started services with\nSignature Health. Her counselor, who testified as a witness called by\n[Mother] stated that they were just in the process of setting treatment\ngoals, that [Mother] had attended four of the five on-line thirty-minute\nsessions and had been at least ten minutes late to two of them.\n\nThe Mother’s behavior was described [by] both witnesses for the\nagency and the GAL as aggressive. While Mother may have made\nprogress in addressing her communication skills, the testimony,\nevidence and her courtroom behavior are clear and convincing\nevidence that the child’s stability would be at a severe risk if reunified\nwith her. There was testimony about an incident in August of 2022\nwhere the Mother was shot during an argument. Arguments involving\n\f      the Mother and multiple other people during visits and outside of visits\n      over the entire course of this case demonstrate a pervasive pattern.\n\n(J.E., Sept. 16, 2024, R. 377.)\n\n                 We note that the court is only required to find one of the\n\nR.C. 2151.414(E) factors present to enter a finding that a child cannot or should be\n\nplaced with a parent. In re D.H., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7799795\"><a href=\"/opinion/7855929/in-re-dh/#29\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re D.H.\">2022-Ohio-2780, ¶ 29</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, citing In re L.W., 2019-\n\nOhio-1343 (8th Dist.). Here, the court made five. According to R.C. 2151.414(E), if\n\nthe court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that one or more of the\n\n(E)(1)-(16) factors exist, the court shall enter a finding that the child cannot be\n\nplaced with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with\n\neither parent.     Because the trial court found five of the factors set forth in\n\nR.C. 2151.414(E) applied in S.S.’s case, it correctly found that S.S. cannot or should\n\nnot be placed with either parent. Furthermore, the trial court fittingly acknowledged\n\nthat “[t]he issue before the court is the child’s best interest, not the Mother’s\n\nprogress. . . . None of the witnesses who testified in Mother’s case addressed the\n\nchild’s best interest[.]” (J.E., Sept. 16, 2024, R. 377.)\n\n                 After reviewing the entire record, we cannot say that the juvenile\n\ncourt’s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence when it granted the\n\nAgency’s motion for permanent custody of S.S. and terminated Mother’s parental\n\nrights. Accordingly, Mother’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                 Judgments affirmed.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\f      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court, juvenile division, to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nMARY J.

Hardy-Senkel\n    S.R.S.,                                                   )\n                                                              )\n              Appellant.                                      )   Filed: October 29, 2024\n\n                                                    Introduction\n\n           S.R.S. (“Appellant”) appeals the circuit court’s judgment entering a ten-year full order of\n\nprotection to K.E.S. In his sole point on appeal, Appellant argues the circuit court erred because\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to extend the order of protection’s term under § 455.040.1(4).1 The\n\ncircuit court’s judgment found Appellant poses a “serious danger to the physical or mental health”\n\nof K.E.S. Because there was sufficient evidence to support this finding, the circuit court’s\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n                                     Factual and Procedural Background\n\n           The circuit court found K.E.S.’s testimony to be “candid and credible.” Appellant offered\n\nno evidence. Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence is as follows:2\n\n\n\n\n1\n    All statutory references are to RSMo. Cum. Supp. (2021), unless otherwise specified.\n2\n    D.A.T. v. M.A.T., 413 S.W.3d 665, 668 (Mo. App. E.D. 2013).\n\f       K.E.S.’s father physically abused her as a child; she watched as he abused three other\n\nwomen as well. While the police were often called, in K.E.S.’s experience, the police always\n\nblamed the woman. K.E.S. testified these experiences influenced her relationship with Appellant.\n\n       Appellant and K.E.S. started a romantic relationship in February 2022. About six weeks\n\nlater, on April 14th, Appellant and K.E.S. went on a date. As Appellant was driving K.E.S. home,\n\nhe berated her. He called her “crazy,” “a psycho,” “stupid fucking bitch,” and a “stupid fucking\n\ncunt.” When K.E.S. arrived home, she went to her bedroom and locked the door. Appellant\n\nfollowed her inside the house. He ran down the hallway and banged on her locked, six-panel\n\nbedroom door so forcefully he punched a large hole in it. The force of Appellant’s blows knocked\n\nthe door off its hinges.\n\n       Soon after, K.E.S. searched Appellant’s name on Case.net and learned he had pled guilty\n\nto an assault charge in 2005. Although Appellant originally told her the charge was from a college\n\nbar fight, he eventually admitted the plea arose after his girlfriend’s friend accused him of rape\n\nand assault.\n\n       On July 11th, Appellant repeatedly text messaged K.E.S. He called her “toxic,”\n\n“manipulative,” “psycho,” “stupid fucking bitch,” “bitch,” “stupid fucking cunt,” “fucking cunt,”\n\nand more. He demanded they meet that day, but K.E.S. refused. Appellant then showed up at her\n\nhouse unannounced. She repeatedly asked him to leave, to no avail. Appellant begged K.E.S. to\n\nopen the door so they could talk. She complied, only opening the front door while keeping her\n\nscreen door closed. As she opened the front door, Appellant opened her screen door and barged\n\nheadfirst into her home. She tried to close the front door on him but he pushed her back. K.E.S.\n\nfled to her bedroom. She asked him to leave, and he laughed at her, calling her “crazy” and\n\n“psycho.” Appellant eventually retreated from the bedroom to the main part of the house.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fSometime later, K.E.S. left her bedroom to retrieve her purse. Appellant snatched the purse off her\n\narm and threw it on the kitchen table. He then slapped her behind and restrained her on his lap.\n\nK.E.S. returned to her bedroom. She watched Appellant sitting in the dark on her couch from her\n\nhome camera. She could not fall asleep. Around 2:00 a.m., just before he left the house, Appellant\n\ncommented about her refusing to have sex with him and called her “worthless” and “toxic.”\n\n       The next day, July 12th, Appellant barraged K.E.S. with text messages and phone calls. He\n\nalternated between apologizing for his behavior and calling her a “stupid fucking cunt” and other\n\nnames. She blocked his phone number but he made calls with no caller ID and broke through the\n\nblock. Appellant invited K.E.S. to attend the Cardinals game that night with his friends. She agreed\n\nbecause she hoped Appellant would be on better behavior in public and thought this would stop\n\nthe incessant phone calls and text messages. On the drive home, K.E.S. and Appellant started\n\nfighting, prompting K.E.S to break up with him. At this point, he tried to hold her hand but K.E.S.\n\nrefused. Appellant responded by calling her “crazy” and a “fucking bitch.” Appellant started\n\ndriving 100 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, screeched to a halt, and told her to “get the\n\nfuck out of his car.” K.E.S. exited the car and began the two-and-a-half to three-mile walk home.\n\nAppellant headed home, but turned around and drove towards K.E.S.’s home. Appellant caught up\n\nwith K.E.S. and asked if she wanted a ride. K.E.S. refused. Appellant told her he would let himself\n\ninside her house. K.E.S. insisted she did not want him there. He responded, “love you.”\n\n       When K.E.S. arrived home, she discovered Appellant somehow inside her house and naked\n\non her bed. Although Appellant claimed the front door was open, K.E.S. credibly testified it was\n\nnot. She asked him to leave, and he responded by calling her more vulgar names. Initially, K.E.S.\n\noffered to let him stay in her basement because she could lock the basement door to deny Appellant\n\naccess to the rest of her house. When this did not satisfy Appellant, K.E.S. picked up his clothes,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftook them outside, and put them on the hood of his car. While Appellant followed her outside and\n\ngrabbed his clothes, K.E.S. ran back inside. Appellant chased her and rammed her headfirst\n\nthrough the door. Inside the house, Appellant threw K.E.S. on the floor, flung her against the TV\n\nstand, and hurled her onto the coffee table. He put her in a headlock on the floor. K.E.S. freed\n\nherself, stumbled out the front door, and ran to a neighbor’s house. She asked the neighbor to call\n\n911. The City of Arnold police responded to the 911 call. Appellant later informed K.E.S. he had\n\nincreased his steroid usage well beyond the prescribed amount. He blamed his steroid usage for\n\nhis physical assaults. From this date on, K.E.S. only saw Appellant in public or in the presence of\n\nhis children.\n\n       For the next few days, Appellant continuously called and text messaged K.E.S. On July\n\n13th, Appellant’s five-year-old twins appeared at her door with flowers and a box. They told her\n\ntheir dad sent them to give her presents. Despite her abusive relationship with Appellant, K.E.S.\n\nloved his kids. Because she had had two miscarriages, Appellant told her his twins could be her\n\n“new children.” K.E.S. accepted the gifts, sent the children back to Appellant, and locked her front\n\ndoor. Thirty seconds later, the doorbell rang again. This time, the twins said Appellant told them\n\nthey could use her restroom. K.E.S. let the twins inside, and Appellant ran up to the door asking\n\nto talk. She shut the door and ushered the kids out after they used the restroom.\n\n       Over the next two weeks, Appellant continued his incessant text messages and phone calls.\n\nOn July 28th, K.E.S. relented and agreed to walk her dog with him in public. On the walk,\n\nAppellant started a fight. K.E.S. headed home. Appellant—once again—showed up to her house\n\nuninvited. K.E.S. locked her front door, turned off all the lights, and sat in her dark hallway.\n\nAppellant banged on her front door, banged on and peered into her son’s bedroom window, and\n\nmade his way into her gated backyard. Appellant peeped into her bedroom window. Seeing no\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fone, he climbed the deck stairs and tried to enter through a sliding glass door. He broke the door’s\n\nlock but could not get past the bar along the bottom. Appellant continued texting K.E.S., asking to\n\ntalk with her. She told him he was scaring her and asked him to leave her house. Appellant left her\n\ndriveway, then returned, and knocked on K.E.S.’s door again. When K.E.S. did not answer,\n\nAppellant texted her from his car. He told her the situation was “crazy,” she was being “dramatic,”\n\nand was in a “toxic state.” Appellant left soon after.\n\n       Appellant would use his kids whenever the two got into an argument. K.E.S. would receive\n\nseveral voicemails, video messages, audio messages, and videos of his twins crying because they\n\nmissed her. They begged to see her and her son again. Given Appellant said they could be her\n\n“new children,” the messages were painful for K.E.S. On September 9th, K.E.S. agreed to see\n\nAppellant and his twins. When he began to insult her with vulgar names, she cancelled. On\n\nSeptember 23rd, she agreed to go bowling with Appellant and his twins. Thirty minutes before the\n\nevent, Appellant told K.E.S. one of the twins wanted to watch a movie at his home instead. K.E.S.\n\nsaid that made her uncomfortable, but, because she had promised to see the twins, she went to\n\nAppellant’s home. After they put the twins to bed, Appellant tried to force himself on K.E.S. She\n\nleft. The next day was her son’s birthday, and she told Appellant he was not welcome at the party.\n\nAppellant sent her a video of the twins wishing her son a happy birthday.\n\n       In the days after September 23rd, K.E.S. learned the City of Arnold had charged Appellant\n\nwith assault from the July 13th incident. She testified this charge proved to her the legal system\n\ncould protect her from abuse. From this day forward, she never physically saw Appellant. He\n\ncontinued to call and send her text messages throughout October and November. He sent her more\n\ntext messages on December 5th. K.E.S. decided only an order of protection would keep him from\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fcontacting her. She filed a petition for an order of protection on December 6th. The next day, the\n\ncircuit court granted her an ex parte order of protection.\n\n       At the hearing for the full order of protection, K.E.S. was asked why she never called the\n\npolice. She credibly testified Appellant had threatened to call her ex-husband and “blow up” her\n\nlife, to use his legal connections to avoid criminal charges (as he had in the past), and to call her\n\nemployer. The circuit court issued a ten-year full order of protection. It found K.E.S. had “tried to\n\nend the relationship in a manner that did not involve the extreme remedy of an order of protection,\n\nbut [Appellant] failed to stop contacting her.” It made written findings Appellant had “abused and\n\nstalked” K.E.S. and posed a “serious danger to [her] physical or mental health.” The order of\n\nprotection prohibited Appellant from (1) communicating with K.E.S. in any manner, including\n\nthrough third parties, (2) committing or threatening to commit domestic violence, molesting,\n\nstalking, sexual assault, or disturbing the peace of K.E.S., (3) abusing or threatening to abuse her\n\npets, and (4) from coming within 1,000 feet of her. K.E.S. has not heard directly from Appellant\n\nsince the entry of her ex parte order. This appeal follows.\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       “In an appeal from a court-tried civil case, [this Court’s] review is governed by Murphy v.\n\nCarron.” E.M.B. v. A.L., 462 S.W.3d 450, 452 (Mo. App. E.D. 2015). “In reviewing … full orders\n\nof protection, this Court will sustain the judgment of the trial court unless there is no evidence to\n\nsupport it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.”\n\nL.M.M. v. J.L.G., 619 S.W.3d 593, 596 (Mo. App. E.D. 2021). “[This Court] view[s] the facts and\n\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the judgment.” Id. “The reviewing court will\n\ndefer to the trial court’s determinations of witness credibility, as the trial court is in a superior\n\nposition to assess credibility.” N.C. v. Y.Q.L., 609 S.W.3d 56, 58 (Mo. App. E.D. 2020). “Because\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fthe trial judge is in the best position to gauge the credibility of the witnesses, in cases under the\n\nAdult Abuse Act, the discretion of the trial court should not often be superseded.” K.M.C. v.\n\nM.W.M., 518 S.W.3d 273, 276–77 (Mo. App. E.D. 2017).\n\n                                                       Discussion\n\n      Point I: Sufficiency to Support Circuit Court Finding Appellant Poses a Serious Danger to\n                                  K.E.S.’s Mental or Physical Health\n                                            Party Positions\n\n           In his sole point on appeal, Appellant argues the circuit court erred in entering a full order\n\nof protection for a ten-year term under § 455.040.1(4) because there was insufficient evidence to\n\nextend the protective order’s term when applying the statutory factors. He argues K.E.S. could not\n\nhave been scared of him because she continued to go on dates with him. K.E.S. contends there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the circuit court’s judgment under the factors because her credible,\n\nunrebutted, and unimpeached testimony demonstrated Appellant poses a serious danger to her\n\nphysical or mental health.\n\n                                                         Analysis\n\n           “The Missouri Adult Abuse Act provides that any adult may seek an order of protection by\n\nfiling a verified petition alleging domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault.” L.M.M., 619\n\nS.W.3d 593 at 596. When originally enacted, the maximum term for a full order of protection was\n\none year. S.A.B. v. J.L.R., 675 S.W.3d 245, 256 (Mo. App. E.D. 2023). The Legislature amended\n\nthe statute in 2021 to allow for an extension of the term for up to ten years if a court made “specific\n\nwritten findings” the respondent poses a “serious danger to the physical or mental health of the\n\npetitioner.” § 455.040.1(1); see also L.E.C. v. K.R.C., 674 S.W.3d 97, 107 n.10 (Mo. App. E.D.\n\n2023).3 In determining if a respondent poses a serious danger to the physical or mental health of\n\n\n\n3\n    Respondent, in this context, refers to the respondent named in the original order of protection petition.\n\n\n                                                             7\n\fthe petitioner, § 455.040.1(4) requires circuit courts to “consider all relevant evidence including,\n\nbut not limited to:\n\n        (a) The weight of the evidence;\n\n        (b) The respondent’s history of inflicting or causing physical harm, bodily injury,\n        or assault;\n\n        (c) The respondent’s history of stalking or causing fear of physical harm, bodily\n        injury, or assault on the petitioner or a minor household member of the petitioner;\n\n        (d) The respondent’s criminal record;\n\n        (e) Whether any prior full orders of adult or child protection have been issued\n        against the respondent;\n\n        (f) Whether the respondent has been found guilty of any dangerous felony under\n        Missouri law; and\n\n        (g) Whether the respondent violated any term or terms of probation or parole or\n        violated any term of a prior full or temporary order of protection and which violated\n        terms were intended to protect the petitioner or a minor household member of the\n        petitioner.”\n\n§ 455.040.1(4)(a)-(g).\n\n        Because no other appellate court has yet analyzed § 455.040.1(4), this Court must engage\n\nin statutory interpretation. “This Court’s primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to\n\nlegislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute at issue.” Parktown Imports, Inc.\n\nv. Audi of Am., Inc., 278 S.W.3d 670, 672 (Mo. banc 2009). “[T]his Court presumes every word,\n\nsentence, or clause in a statute has effect, and the legislature did not insert superfluous language.”\n\nDubuc v. Treasurer of State, 659 S.W.3d 596, 603 (Mo. banc 2023) (quoting Swafford v. Treasurer\n\nof Mo., 659 S.W.3d 580, 583 (Mo. banc 2023)) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n        Section 455.040.1(4) is a factor test, not an element test. The Legislature stated “including,\n\nbut not limited to” before listing the seven factors to consider in making the “serious danger”\n\ndetermination. § 455.040.1(4). When the Legislature has used similar or identical language before\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fa list of statutory factors in other contexts, courts have deemed the list non-exclusive. See Sutton\n\nv. McCollum, 421 S.W.3d 477, 483 (Mo. App. S.D. 2013) (characterizing § 452.375.2, which\n\nstates, “[w]hen the parties have not reached an agreement on all issues related to custody, the court\n\nshall consider all relevant factors and enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, the following” as providing non-exclusive factors) (emphasis added);\n\nR. S. v. Dunklin Cnty. Juv. Off., 685 S.W.3d 600, 606 (Mo. App. S.D. 2024) (stating § 211.071.6’s\n\n“criteria [for certification of juvenile as adult] shall include but be not limited to” is a list of non-\n\nexhaustive factors) (emphasis added). Similarly, this Court holds § 455.040.1(4)’s list of factors is\n\nnon-exhaustive.4\n\n           As with other non-exhaustive factor determinations, “the trial court need not give greater\n\nweight to certain factors than others.” Sutton, 421 S.W.3d at 483; see also R. S., 685 S.W.3d at\n\n606. There is no specific formula for weighing the statutory list. Sutton, 421 S.W.3d at 483; R. S.,\n\n685 S.W.3d at 606. The circuit court is entitled to significant discretion when weighing the factors.\n\nSee R. S., 685 S.W.3d at 606.\n\n           Appellant concedes there was sufficient evidence for the circuit court to enter a full order\n\nof protection against him for stalking and abusing K.E.S. There is a “potential stigma that may\n\nattach to an individual who is labelled a ‘stalker’ under the Missouri Adult Abuse Act.” J.R.C. v.\n\nS.L.F., 686 S.W.3d 673, 678 (Mo. App. E.D. 2024) (quoting K.L.M. v. B.A.G., 532 S.W.3d 706,\n\n709 (Mo. App. E.D. 2017)). Appellant cannot now contest the stigma that will arise from this\n\ndetermination because he has conceded he is a stalker. The only issue before this Court is whether\n\nthere was sufficient evidence to find Appellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical or\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Appellant agreed at oral argument the statute lists factors, not elements.\n\n\n                                                              9\n\fmental health to enter a full order of protection beyond one year. This Court will discuss each\n\nfactor.\n\n                                      (a) Weight of the Evidence\n\n          The first factor is the weight of the evidence. “‘Weight’ means the probative value of\n\nevidence, not the quantity.” Day v. Hupp, 528 S.W.3d 400, 411 (Mo. App. E.D. 2017). “The weight\n\nof the evidence is not determined by mathematics, but on its effect in inducing belief.” Houston v.\n\nCrider, 317 S.W.3d 178, 186 (Mo. App. S.D. 2010). “A contention that a necessary proposition is\n\nagainst the weight of the evidence challenges the probative value of that evidence to induce belief\n\nin the disputed proposition when viewed in the context of the entirety of the evidence before the\n\ntrier of fact.” Day, 528 S.W.3d at 411. “[A]n against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge\n\nrequires completion of four sequential steps:\n\n          (1) identify a challenged factual proposition, the existence of which is necessary to\n          sustain the judgment;\n\n          (2) identify all of the favorable evidence in the record supporting the existence of\n          that proposition;\n\n          (3) identify the evidence in the record contrary to the belief of that proposition,\n          resolving all conflicts in testimony in accordance with the trial court’s credibility\n          determinations, whether explicit or implicit; and,\n\n          (4) demonstrate why the favorable evidence, along with the reasonable inferences\n          drawn from that evidence, is so lacking in probative value, when considered in the\n          context of the totality of the evidence, that it fails to induce belief in that\n          proposition.”\n\nHouston, 317 S.W.3d at 187.\n\n          “[A] failure to fully identify and develop the evidence favorable to the finding …\n\nnecessarily undermines the[] ability to demonstrate how that favorable evidence did not have\n\nprobative force upon the issue … such that the trier of fact could not reasonably decide its\n\nexistence[.]” Id. at 188.\n\n\n\n                                                   10\n\f        “To support a favorable decision for [Appellant] on this point would require this\n        Court to devise and articulate its own demonstration of how the omitted favorable\n        evidence … [is] against the weight of the evidence. Such action on our part would\n        thrust us into becoming an advocate on [Appellant’s] behalf; a role we are\n        prohibited from assuming.”\n\nId. at 189.\n\n        First, Appellant identifies the challenged factual proposition he poses a “serious danger to\n\nthe physical and mental health” of K.E.S. This proposition is necessary to the judgment because,\n\nwithout this factual finding, the circuit court could not have imposed the ten-year term. Second,\n\nAppellant cites no facts favorable to the circuit court’s judgment in his point relied on and\n\nargument section. Instead, he makes only slanted references which reduce, minimize, and omit\n\nmaterial facts supporting the seriousness of his actions.\n\n        In Appellant’s retelling of the April 14th encounter, he merely “damaged [K.E.S.]’s\n\nproperty by putting a hole in [her] bedroom door.” The event was much more severe than his\n\nversion makes it seem. Before arriving at K.E.S.’s house, Appellant had called her “crazy,” “a\n\npsycho,” “stupid fucking bitch,” and a “stupid fucking cunt.” Appellant did not just “put[] a hole\n\nin [K.E.S.’s] bedroom door.” He ran down K.E.S.’s hallway and banged on her six-panel door so\n\nviolently he punched a hole in it and knocked it off its hinges.\n\n        In Appellant’s retelling of the July 11th incident, he just “called [K.E.S.] vulgar names,”\n\n“refus[ed] to leave her home” and eventually “left [K.E.S.]’s home” with “[n]othing physical\n\noccur[ing].” The record refutes “nothing physical” occurred on this day because Appellant:\n\n(1) barged headfirst through her screen door, pushing her back, (2) snatched her purse off her arm,\n\n(3) restrained her on his lap, and (4) slapped her behind. The circuit court cited this incident to find\n\nAppellant assaulted K.E.S. under § 455.010(1)(b).5\n\n\n5\n The Adult Abuse Act defines “assault” as “purposely or knowingly placing or attempting to place another in fear of\nphysical harm.” § 455.010(1)(b).\n\n\n                                                        11\n\f       Appellant described the events of July 12th and 13th as merely an “incident in which\n\nAppellant got physical with [K.E.S.] and she broke up with [him].” Again, K.E.S.’s credible\n\ntestimony refutes Appellant’s characterization of this incident. While Appellant drove K.E.S.\n\nhome, he berated her with epithets. When K.E.S. announced she was breaking up with him,\n\nAppellant left her on the side of the road to walk the two-and-a-half or three miles home. When\n\nshe arrived home, K.E.S. found him somehow in her house and naked in her bed. She put his\n\nclothes on the hood of his car and ran back to her house. Appellant ran outside, picked up his\n\nclothes and—before she could close the door —slammed her headfirst through it. Appellant then\n\nthrew her to the floor, picked her up, and threw her against the TV stand and coffee table. He put\n\nher in a headlock on the floor. K.E.S. only escaped because she kicked her legs out and stumbled\n\nthrough the front door. Nowhere in Appellant’s point relied on and argument section is any\n\nmention Appellant had increased his steroid dosage beyond his prescribed level. Nowhere in those\n\nsections does Appellant acknowledge he blamed the physical assaults on his steroid increase.\n\n       Appellant likewise minimizes the events of July 28th as a “verbal altercation” because he\n\nshowed up “to [K.E.S.]’s house uninvited.” Again, Appellant omits several key facts from this\n\nencounter: (1) K.E.S. locked her doors, (2) turned off the lights, and (3) sat in her dark hallway so\n\nAppellant would leave. Appellant does not mention he made his way into K.E.S.’s gated backyard\n\nand peered into her bedroom window. He overlooks the fact he climbed her deck stairs and\n\nattempted to break into the house.\n\n       Also absent from Appellant’s analysis is his callous use of his five-year-old twins. Because\n\nAppellant had had two miscarriages, he told her his twins could be her “new children.” When\n\nAppellant began to see K.E.S. more sporadically after the physical assault, he used his children to\n\nconvince her to see him again. He would, for example, send K.E.S. videos of his children crying\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fbecause they missed her and her son. On September 23rd, his twins curiously changed their minds\n\nabout a public bowling outing for a private movie session. On September 24th, after K.E.S. told\n\nAppellant he was not welcome at her son’s birthday party, he sent her a video of his young twins\n\nwishing her son a happy birthday.\n\n       These facts, taken together, form favorable evidence supporting the existence of the\n\nproposition Appellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health. Appellant’s\n\nfailure to identify favorable evidence is fatal to his weight of the evidence claim in step four.\n\nHouston, 317 S.W.3d at 188.\n\n       Third, Appellant marshals a few pieces of evidence contrary to the belief he poses a serious\n\ndanger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health. Appellant notes K.E.S. frequently would block and\n\nunblock Appellant’s phone number. He also contends that despite testifying numerous times she\n\nwas scared of Appellant, K.E.S. continued to date him. He notes K.E.S. never once called the\n\npolice on him. Appellant posits K.E.S. could not have been scared of him because she continued\n\nto voluntarily see him.\n\n        Fourth, Appellant concedes his name calling was “unacceptable” and his pursuit of K.E.S.\n\nwas “aggressive at times.” Still, he argues, his “unacceptable” and “aggressive” behavior lacks\n\nprobative value to support the circuit court’s judgment because it was “reciprocated by [K.E.S.]”\n\nthroughout the relationship as she was willing to “see and go on dates with” him. Except for the\n\nJuly 12th incident, Appellant claims there were “no physical altercations.”\n\n       Appellant paints an incomplete picture of his and K.E.S.’s relationship and engages in\n\nvictim blaming. Section 455.040 protects all victims who can prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence they endured domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault. L.M.M., 619 S.W.3d at 596.\n\nA person does not forfeit the law’s protections just because they failed to immediately cease all\n\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fcommunications with their abuser and engage the legal system. See Parkhurst v. Parkhurst, 793\n\nS.W.2d 634, 636 (Mo. App. E.D. 1990) (granting an order of protection to a person who had last\n\nbeen abused two-and-a-half months before the filing of the petition). Merely showing K.E.S. did\n\nnot respond to Appellant’s abuse as he deemed proper does not demonstrate why the\n\noverwhelming favorable evidence to support the circuit court’s judgment fails to induce a belief\n\nAppellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health.\n\n       Appellant’s analysis also omits evidence his own actions prevented K.E.S. from calling the\n\npolice. She credibly testified he threatened to “blow up” her life with her ex-husband, to use his\n\nlegal connections to avoid criminal charges (as he had in the past), and to call her employer. In\n\naddition, as the circuit court found, K.E.S. took reasonable steps in her handling of the relationship\n\ngiven her understanding of the law. After the physical assault, she met Appellant only in public or\n\nwith his kids. Once she learned about the assault charge against Appellant in Arnold Municipal\n\nCourt, she felt empowered by the legal system. She never again saw Appellant in person. She\n\nwanted to end the relationship without obtaining an order of protection, but Appellant’s incessant\n\nand unwanted contact forced her hand. It would be unfair for Appellant to benefit from her\n\nhesitancy to engage the legal system when he caused her trepidation.\n\n       Appellant’s against the weight challenge fails because he neglected to identify the\n\nfavorable evidence in the record supporting the existence of the proposition he poses a serious\n\ndanger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health. This Court cannot determine why a proposition lacks\n\nprobative value if the party does not fully identify all favorable evidence supporting that\n\nproposition. Houston, 317 S.W.3d at 188–89. To hold otherwise would require this Court to act as\n\nan advocate for Appellant to demonstrate why the omitted favorable evidence is against the weight\n\nof the evidence. Sound logic and solidified case law forbid this. Murphree v. Lakeshore Estates,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fLLC, 636 S.W.3d 622, 626 (Mo. App. E.D. 2021). These omissions of material favorable evidence\n\ndoom Appellant’s claim. See Houston, 317 S.W.3d at 188.\n\n       Because the circuit court’s finding Appellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical\n\nor mental health is not against the weight of the evidence, this factor weighs in favor of entry of\n\nthe extended order of protection.\n\n                 (b) Appellant’s History of Inflicting or Causing Physical Harm\n\n       Appellant argues there was no evidence to support this factor aside from K.E.S.’s testimony\n\nshe learned of Appellant’s “prior assault charge” from 2005. Since K.E.S. did not provide a\n\ncertified copy of this conviction, Appellant argues there was no history of his inflicting or causing\n\nphysical harm presented at trial. This argument mischaracterizes the evidence.\n\n       “[I]f accepted as true by the fact trier, the testimony of a single witness is sufficient to\n\nestablish any fact ….” Guengerich v. Barker, 423 S.W.3d 331, 341 (Mo. App. S.D. 2014) (quoting\n\nMcClelland v. Williamson, 627 S.W.2d 94, 98 (Mo. App. S.D. 1982)). K.E.S. testified Appellant\n\ntold her he had pled guilty to an assault case arising from rape and assault allegations—not just\n\nthat he was charged. Because Appellant offered no rebuttal testimony on this point, and because\n\nthe circuit court found K.E.S. credible, her testimony sufficiently establishes Appellant assaulted\n\na woman in 2005.\n\n       Because Appellant has a history of inflicting or causing physical harm, this factor weighs\n\nin favor of entry of the extended order of protection.\n\n      (c) Appellant’s History of Stalking or Causing Fear of Physical Harm, Bodily Injury,\n                                       or Assault on K.E.S.\n\n       Appellant argues this factor weighs in his favor because the relationship lasted only nine\n\nmonths, he did not contact K.E.S. after she sought an order of protection, there was only one\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fphysical incident between them, and only one incident of assault under § 455.040. Because K.E.S.\n\ncontinued to see him, Appellant posits she could not have feared physical harm from him.\n\n         Appellant’s analysis again minimizes material facts in the record. Appellant concedes there\n\nwas sufficient evidence to support the circuit court’s entry of a full order of protection against him.\n\nThe circuit court found Appellant committed all four acts this factor identifies: stalking, causing\n\nfear of physical harm, bodily injury, and assault. It found he stalked K.E.S. under § 455.040 when\n\nhe broke her bedroom door on April 14th, physically restrained her on July 11th, physically\n\nassaulted her on July 13th, and peered into her windows on July 28th. It also found his incessant\n\ntext messages, especially after K.E.S. told him to stop contacting her, were unwanted and\n\nconstituted stalking.6 The circuit court used those same incidents to prove Appellant caused K.E.S.\n\nto fear physical harm from him. The July 13th incident—when Appellant rammed K.E.S. headfirst\n\nthrough her door, threw her around her living room, and put her in a headlock—is sufficient to\n\nprove bodily injury.7 Finally, the circuit court found Appellant assaulted K.E.S. under § 455.040\n\nbecause of the events of April 14th, July 11th, July 13th, and July 28th, as discussed previously.\n\nAppellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support these findings.\n\n         Because Appellant had a history of stalking, causing fear of physical harm, bodily injury,\n\nand assault on K.E.S., this factor weighs in favor of the entry of the extended order of protection.\n\n                                              (d) Criminal Record\n\n         Appellant argues because K.E.S. did not produce certified copies of his criminal record at\n\nthe hearing, there was no evidence of this factor for the circuit court to consider. K.E.S. contends\n\n\n6\n  Section 455.010(15) defines “stalking” as “when any person purposely engages in an unwanted course of conduct\nthat causes alarm to another person ... when it is reasonable in that person’s situation to have been alarmed by the\nconduct.” “Alarm” means “to cause fear of danger of physical harm.” § 455.010(15)(a). “Course of conduct” means\n“two or more acts that serve no legitimate purpose including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly,\nindirectly, or through a third party follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to a person by\nany action, method, or device.” § 455.010(15)(b).\n7\n  “Battery” is “purposely or knowingly causing physical harm to another ....” § 455.010(1)(c).\n\n\n                                                         16\n\fa screenshot of Case.net, her testimony, and the circuit court’s judicial notice of the Arnold\n\nmunicipal case are adequate to support this factor.\n\n       Because this Court presumes “every clause in a statute has effect, and the legislature did\n\nnot insert superfluous language,” each factor must have an independent meaning. See Dubuc, 659\n\nS.W.3d at 603 (quoting Swafford, 659 S.W.3d at 583). Because this Court must give every clause\n\neffect, it follows “criminal history” and “criminal record” must be afforded different meanings.\n\nThe statute does not define “criminal record.” Webster’s Third defines “record” as “(2) something\n\nthat serves to record, as: … (4) : an official contemporaneous memorandum stating the proceedings\n\nof a court of justice (5) : an official copy of the legal papers used in a case and of memoranda of\n\nthe proceedings of the court.” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT’L DICTIONARY 1898 (2002).\n\nFor purposes of § 455.040.1(4)(d), “criminal record” means official documentation of legal\n\nproceedings. These legal proceedings encompass the entire range of citizen contact with the justice\n\nsystem from arrest to conviction to release. § 610.140.2 (“any person may apply to any court in\n\nwhich such person was charged or found guilty of any offenses, violations, or infractions for an\n\norder to expunge records of such arrest, plea, trial, or conviction.”) (emphasis added); see also\n\n11 C.S.R. § 30-4.010(3) (defining criminal history record information as “identifiable descriptions\n\nand notations of arrests, detentions, indictments, information or other formal criminal charges and\n\nany disposition arising from criminal charges, sentencing, correctional supervision and release.”).\n\n       K.E.S. provided a Case.net screenshot of a 10-count charge for assault, rape, and sodomy\n\nin St. Charles County. “Case.net is not an official record.” Johnson v. McCullough, 306 S.W.3d\n\n551, 559 n.4 (Mo. banc 2010). Because Case.net is not an official record, it cannot be relied upon\n\nto prove Appellant’s criminal record. Likewise, K.E.S.’s testimony regarding Appellant’s 2005\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fplea and the St. Charles County case provide no official documentation of legal proceedings. They\n\nare not considered part of his criminal record under § 455.040.1(4)(d).\n\n       Taking judicial notice of official documentation of legal proceedings is permissible to\n\nprove a criminal record. Here, the circuit court took judicial notice of the charges pending against\n\nAppellant in Arnold Municipal Court. “Courts may take judicial notice of other proceedings when\n\nthe cases are interwoven or interdependent.” Branch v. State, 531 S.W.3d 621, 624 (Mo. App. E.D.\n\n2017) (quoting Envtl. Utilities, LLC v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 219 S.W.3d 256, 265 (Mo. App. W.D.\n\n2007)). Two cases involving (1) the same perpetrator(s) and victim(s), and (2) related factual\n\nscenarios are interwoven or interdependent. State v. Flores, 437 S.W.3d 779, 787 n.7 (Mo. App.\n\nW.D. 2014) (holding appellate court could take judicial notice of former codefendant’s severed\n\ncase); see also State v. Weber, 814 S.W.2d 298, 303–04 (Mo. App. E.D. 1991) (holding circuit\n\ncourt could take judicial notice of protective order filed in subsequent criminal prosecution for\n\nburglary).\n\n       Here, the Arnold municipal case involved (1) the same perpetrator and victim (Appellant\n\nand K.E.S.) and (2) a related factual scenario (the July 13th assault) as the order of protection case.\n\nThus, the circuit court properly took judicial notice of the Arnold municipal case to which\n\nAppellant offered no objection at trial. By taking judicial notice of the Arnold municipal case (and\n\nits official documentation of legal proceedings), K.E.S. proved Appellant had a criminal record.\n\n       Finally, certified copies are not required under § 455.040.1(4)(d) to prove a criminal record.\n\nThe statute calls for analysis of Appellant’s “criminal record,” not a “certified criminal record.”\n\n§ 455.040.1(4)(d). Appellant is trying to insert a word into the statute that is simply not present.\n\n       Because the circuit court had evidence before it regarding Appellant’s criminal record, this\n\nfactor weighs in favor of the entry of an extended order of protection.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f      (e) Whether Any Full Orders of Adult or Child Protection Have Been Issued Against\n                                          Appellant\n\n       Both parties agree there was no evidence presented as to whether any full orders of adult\n\nor child protection have been issued against Appellant. This factor does not weigh in favor of the\n\nentry of the extended order of protection.\n\n            (f) Whether Appellant Has Been Found Guilty of Any Dangerous Felony\n                                    Under Missouri Law\n\n       Both parties agree there was no evidence presented as to whether Appellant has been found\n\nguilty of any dangerous felony under Missouri law. This factor does not weigh in favor of the entry\n\nof the extended order of protection.\n\n                    (g) Whether Appellant Has Violated His Probation, Parole, or\n                    Ex Parte or Full Order of Protection Intended to Protect K.E.S.\n\n       Appellant argues he has never violated any term of probation, parole, or ex parte or full\n\norder of protection intended to protect K.E.S. K.E.S. counters he violated her ex parte order of\n\nprotection twice.\n\n       First, K.E.S. contends, for the first time on appeal, Appellant disseminated private sexual\n\nphotograph(s) and/or video(s) of her days after he was served with the ex parte order of protection.\n\nK.E.S. concedes evidence for this claim is not in the record below. She argues it would nonetheless\n\nbe unfair not to consider her claim because she did not learn of the dissemination until after the\n\nhearing. It would have been impossible for her to have testified to something she knew nothing\n\nabout. K.E.S. cites no legal authority justifying an exception to this Court’s general rule it “will\n\nnot consider evidence outside the record on appeal.” Day, 528 S.W.3d at 412. K.E.S. alternatively\n\nargues because Appellant omitted this information in his brief when arguing he never violated the\n\norder of protection, he “opened the door” to correcting this omission. This argument presents a\n\nrule of evidence. Sherrer v. Boston Sci. Corp., 609 S.W.3d 697, 708 (Mo. banc 2020). This rule of\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fevidence, however, is not an exception to this Court’s general rule. Day, 528 S.W.3d at 412.\n\nBecause the evidence of Appellant’s alleged dissemination was outside of the record on appeal,\n\nthis Court declines to consider the argument.\n\n       Second, K.E.S. testified Appellant had his “attorney friend” contact her when he was\n\nserved with the ex parte order of protection. K.E.S. argues this contact violated the order of\n\nprotection’s prohibition on third-party contact. This Court need not decide this question. Even\n\nassuming this third-party contact did not result in Appellant violating the order of protection, this\n\nCourt holds factors (a) through (d) provided sufficient evidence Appellant poses a serious danger\n\nto K.E.S.’s physical or mental health.\n\n       For these reasons, the circuit court appropriately applied the factors in § 455.040.1(4)(a)-\n\n(g). The circuit court did not err in finding Appellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical\n\nor mental health. The ten-year term for the order of protection is supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nPoint I is denied.\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       The circuit court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                _______________________________\n                                                Philip M.

(“Appellant”) appeals the circuit court’s judgment entering a ten-year full order of\n\nprotection to K.E.S. In his sole point on appeal, Appellant argues the circuit court erred because\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to extend the order of protection’s term under § 455.040.1(4).1 The\n\ncircuit court’s judgment found Appellant poses a “serious danger to the physical or mental health”\n\nof K.E.S. Because there was sufficient evidence to support this finding, the circuit court’s\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n                                     Factual and Procedural Background\n\n           The circuit court found K.E.S.’s testimony to be “candid and credible.” Appellant offered\n\nno evidence. Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence is as follows:2\n\n\n\n\n1\n    All statutory references are to RSMo. Cum. Supp. (2021), unless otherwise specified.\n2\n    D.A.T. v. M.A.T., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5114365\"><a href=\"/opinion/5285966/dat-v-mat/#668\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: D.A.T. v. M.A.T.\">413 S.W.3d 665, 668</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. App. E.D. 2013).\n\f       K.E.S.’s father physically abused her as a child; she watched as he abused three other\n\nwomen as well. While the police were often called, in K.E.S.’s experience, the police always\n\nblamed the woman. K.E.S. testified these experiences influenced her relationship with Appellant.\n\n       Appellant and K.E.S. started a romantic relationship in February 2022. About six weeks\n\nlater, on April 14th, Appellant and K.E.S. went on a date. As Appellant was driving K.E.S. home,\n\nhe berated her. He called her “crazy,” “a psycho,” “stupid fucking bitch,” and a “stupid fucking\n\ncunt.” When K.E.S. arrived home, she went to her bedroom and locked the door. Appellant\n\nfollowed her inside the house. He ran down the hallway and banged on her locked, six-panel\n\nbedroom door so forcefully he punched a large hole in it. The force of Appellant’s blows knocked\n\nthe door off its hinges.\n\n       Soon after, K.E.S. searched Appellant’s name on Case.net and learned he had pled guilty\n\nto an assault charge in 2005. Although Appellant originally told her the charge was from a college\n\nbar fight, he eventually admitted the plea arose after his girlfriend’s friend accused him of rape\n\nand assault.\n\n       On July 11th, Appellant repeatedly text messaged K.E.S. He called her “toxic,”\n\n“manipulative,” “psycho,” “stupid fucking bitch,” “bitch,” “stupid fucking cunt,” “fucking cunt,”\n\nand more. He demanded they meet that day, but K.E.S. refused. Appellant then showed up at her\n\nhouse unannounced. She repeatedly asked him to leave, to no avail. Appellant begged K.E.S. to\n\nopen the door so they could talk. She complied, only opening the front door while keeping her\n\nscreen door closed. As she opened the front door, Appellant opened her screen door and barged\n\nheadfirst into her home. She tried to close the front door on him but he pushed her back. K.E.S.\n\nfled to her bedroom. She asked him to leave, and he laughed at her, calling her “crazy” and\n\n“psycho.” Appellant eventually retreated from the bedroom to the main part of the house.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fSometime later, K.E.S. left her bedroom to retrieve her purse. Appellant snatched the purse off her\n\narm and threw it on the kitchen table. He then slapped her behind and restrained her on his lap.\n\nK.E.S. returned to her bedroom. She watched Appellant sitting in the dark on her couch from her\n\nhome camera. She could not fall asleep. Around 2:00 a.m., just before he left the house, Appellant\n\ncommented about her refusing to have sex with him and called her “worthless” and “toxic.”\n\n       The next day, July 12th, Appellant barraged K.E.S. with text messages and phone calls. He\n\nalternated between apologizing for his behavior and calling her a “stupid fucking cunt” and other\n\nnames. She blocked his phone number but he made calls with no caller ID and broke through the\n\nblock. Appellant invited K.E.S. to attend the Cardinals game that night with his friends. She agreed\n\nbecause she hoped Appellant would be on better behavior in public and thought this would stop\n\nthe incessant phone calls and text messages. On the drive home, K.E.S. and Appellant started\n\nfighting, prompting K.E.S to break up with him. At this point, he tried to hold her hand but K.E.S.\n\nrefused. Appellant responded by calling her “crazy” and a “fucking bitch.” Appellant started\n\ndriving 100 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, screeched to a halt, and told her to “get the\n\nfuck out of his car.” K.E.S. exited the car and began the two-and-a-half to three-mile walk home.\n\nAppellant headed home, but turned around and drove towards K.E.S.’s home. Appellant caught up\n\nwith K.E.S. and asked if she wanted a ride. K.E.S. refused. Appellant told her he would let himself\n\ninside her house. K.E.S. insisted she did not want him there. He responded, “love you.”\n\n       When K.E.S. arrived home, she discovered Appellant somehow inside her house and naked\n\non her bed. Although Appellant claimed the front door was open, K.E.S. credibly testified it was\n\nnot. She asked him to leave, and he responded by calling her more vulgar names. Initially, K.E.S.\n\noffered to let him stay in her basement because she could lock the basement door to deny Appellant\n\naccess to the rest of her house. When this did not satisfy Appellant, K.E.S. picked up his clothes,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftook them outside, and put them on the hood of his car. While Appellant followed her outside and\n\ngrabbed his clothes, K.E.S. ran back inside. Appellant chased her and rammed her headfirst\n\nthrough the door. Inside the house, Appellant threw K.E.S. on the floor, flung her against the TV\n\nstand, and hurled her onto the coffee table. He put her in a headlock on the floor. K.E.S. freed\n\nherself, stumbled out the front door, and ran to a neighbor’s house. She asked the neighbor to call\n\n911. The City of Arnold police responded to the 911 call. Appellant later informed K.E.S. he had\n\nincreased his steroid usage well beyond the prescribed amount. He blamed his steroid usage for\n\nhis physical assaults. From this date on, K.E.S. only saw Appellant in public or in the presence of\n\nhis children.\n\n       For the next few days, Appellant continuously called and text messaged K.E.S. On July\n\n13th, Appellant’s five-year-old twins appeared at her door with flowers and a box. They told her\n\ntheir dad sent them to give her presents. Despite her abusive relationship with Appellant, K.E.S.\n\nloved his kids. Because she had had two miscarriages, Appellant told her his twins could be her\n\n“new children.” K.E.S. accepted the gifts, sent the children back to Appellant, and locked her front\n\ndoor. Thirty seconds later, the doorbell rang again. This time, the twins said Appellant told them\n\nthey could use her restroom. K.E.S. let the twins inside, and Appellant ran up to the door asking\n\nto talk. She shut the door and ushered the kids out after they used the restroom.\n\n       Over the next two weeks, Appellant continued his incessant text messages and phone calls.\n\nOn July 28th, K.E.S. relented and agreed to walk her dog with him in public. On the walk,\n\nAppellant started a fight. K.E.S. headed home. Appellant—once again—showed up to her house\n\nuninvited. K.E.S. locked her front door, turned off all the lights, and sat in her dark hallway.\n\nAppellant banged on her front door, banged on and peered into her son’s bedroom window, and\n\nmade his way into her gated backyard. Appellant peeped into her bedroom window. Seeing no\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fone, he climbed the deck stairs and tried to enter through a sliding glass door. He broke the door’s\n\nlock but could not get past the bar along the bottom. Appellant continued texting K.E.S., asking to\n\ntalk with her. She told him he was scaring her and asked him to leave her house. Appellant left her\n\ndriveway, then returned, and knocked on K.E.S.’s door again. When K.E.S. did not answer,\n\nAppellant texted her from his car. He told her the situation was “crazy,” she was being “dramatic,”\n\nand was in a “toxic state.” Appellant left soon after.\n\n       Appellant would use his kids whenever the two got into an argument. K.E.S. would receive\n\nseveral voicemails, video messages, audio messages, and videos of his twins crying because they\n\nmissed her. They begged to see her and her son again. Given Appellant said they could be her\n\n“new children,” the messages were painful for K.E.S. On September 9th, K.E.S. agreed to see\n\nAppellant and his twins. When he began to insult her with vulgar names, she cancelled. On\n\nSeptember 23rd, she agreed to go bowling with Appellant and his twins. Thirty minutes before the\n\nevent, Appellant told K.E.S. one of the twins wanted to watch a movie at his home instead. K.E.S.\n\nsaid that made her uncomfortable, but, because she had promised to see the twins, she went to\n\nAppellant’s home. After they put the twins to bed, Appellant tried to force himself on K.E.S. She\n\nleft. The next day was her son’s birthday, and she told Appellant he was not welcome at the party.\n\nAppellant sent her a video of the twins wishing her son a happy birthday.\n\n       In the days after September 23rd, K.E.S. learned the City of Arnold had charged Appellant\n\nwith assault from the July 13th incident. She testified this charge proved to her the legal system\n\ncould protect her from abuse. From this day forward, she never physically saw Appellant. He\n\ncontinued to call and send her text messages throughout October and November. He sent her more\n\ntext messages on December 5th. K.E.S. decided only an order of protection would keep him from\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fcontacting her. She filed a petition for an order of protection on December 6th. The next day, the\n\ncircuit court granted her an ex parte order of protection.\n\n       At the hearing for the full order of protection, K.E.S. was asked why she never called the\n\npolice. She credibly testified Appellant had threatened to call her ex-husband and “blow up” her\n\nlife, to use his legal connections to avoid criminal charges (as he had in the past), and to call her\n\nemployer. The circuit court issued a ten-year full order of protection. It found K.E.S. had “tried to\n\nend the relationship in a manner that did not involve the extreme remedy of an order of protection,\n\nbut [Appellant] failed to stop contacting her.” It made written findings Appellant had “abused and\n\nstalked” K.E.S. and posed a “serious danger to [her] physical or mental health.” The order of\n\nprotection prohibited Appellant from (1) communicating with K.E.S. in any manner, including\n\nthrough third parties, (2) committing or threatening to commit domestic violence, molesting,\n\nstalking, sexual assault, or disturbing the peace of K.E.S., (3) abusing or threatening to abuse her\n\npets, and (4) from coming within 1,000 feet of her. K.E.S. has not heard directly from Appellant\n\nsince the entry of her ex parte order.

He argues K.E.S. could not\n\nhave been scared of him because she continued to go on dates with him. K.E.S. contends there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the circuit court’s judgment under the factors because her credible,\n\nunrebutted, and unimpeached testimony demonstrated Appellant poses a serious danger to her\n\nphysical or mental health.\n\n                                                         Analysis\n\n           “The Missouri Adult Abuse Act provides that any adult may seek an order of protection by\n\nfiling a verified petition alleging domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault.” L.M.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">619\n\nS.W.3d 593</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 596.

This proposition is necessary to the judgment because,\n\nwithout this factual finding, the circuit court could not have imposed the ten-year term. Second,\n\nAppellant cites no facts favorable to the circuit court’s judgment in his point relied on and\n\nargument section. Instead, he makes only slanted references which reduce, minimize, and omit\n\nmaterial facts supporting the seriousness of his actions.\n\n        In Appellant’s retelling of the April 14th encounter, he merely “damaged [K.E.S.]’s\n\nproperty by putting a hole in [her] bedroom door.” The event was much more severe than his\n\nversion makes it seem. Before arriving at K.E.S.’s house, Appellant had called her “crazy,” “a\n\npsycho,” “stupid fucking bitch,” and a “stupid fucking cunt.” Appellant did not just “put[] a hole\n\nin [K.E.S.’s] bedroom door.” He ran down K.E.S.’s hallway and banged on her six-panel door so\n\nviolently he punched a hole in it and knocked it off its hinges.\n\n        In Appellant’s retelling of the July 11th incident, he just “called [K.E.S.] vulgar names,”\n\n“refus[ed] to leave her home” and eventually “left [K.E.S.]’s home” with “[n]othing physical\n\noccur[ing].” The record refutes “nothing physical” occurred on this day because Appellant:\n\n(1) barged headfirst through her screen door, pushing her back, (2) snatched her purse off her arm,\n\n(3) restrained her on his lap, and (4) slapped her behind. The circuit court cited this incident to find\n\nAppellant assaulted K.E.S. under § 455.010(1)(b).5\n\n\n5\n The Adult Abuse Act defines “assault” as “purposely or knowingly placing or attempting to place another in fear of\nphysical harm.” § 455.010(1)(b).\n\n\n                                                        11\n\f       Appellant described the events of July 12th and 13th as merely an “incident in which\n\nAppellant got physical with [K.E.S.] and she broke up with [him].” Again, K.E.S.’s credible\n\ntestimony refutes Appellant’s characterization of this incident. While Appellant drove K.E.S.\n\nhome, he berated her with epithets. When K.E.S. announced she was breaking up with him,\n\nAppellant left her on the side of the road to walk the two-and-a-half or three miles home. When\n\nshe arrived home, K.E.S. found him somehow in her house and naked in her bed. She put his\n\nclothes on the hood of his car and ran back to her house. Appellant ran outside, picked up his\n\nclothes and—before she could close the door —slammed her headfirst through it. Appellant then\n\nthrew her to the floor, picked her up, and threw her against the TV stand and coffee table. He put\n\nher in a headlock on the floor. K.E.S. only escaped because she kicked her legs out and stumbled\n\nthrough the front door. Nowhere in Appellant’s point relied on and argument section is any\n\nmention Appellant had increased his steroid dosage beyond his prescribed level. Nowhere in those\n\nsections does Appellant acknowledge he blamed the physical assaults on his steroid increase.\n\n       Appellant likewise minimizes the events of July 28th as a “verbal altercation” because he\n\nshowed up “to [K.E.S.]’s house uninvited.” Again, Appellant omits several key facts from this\n\nencounter: (1) K.E.S. locked her doors, (2) turned off the lights, and (3) sat in her dark hallway so\n\nAppellant would leave. Appellant does not mention he made his way into K.E.S.’s gated backyard\n\nand peered into her bedroom window. He overlooks the fact he climbed her deck stairs and\n\nattempted to break into the house.\n\n       Also absent from Appellant’s analysis is his callous use of his five-year-old twins. Because\n\nAppellant had had two miscarriages, he told her his twins could be her “new children.” When\n\nAppellant began to see K.E.S. more sporadically after the physical assault, he used his children to\n\nconvince her to see him again. He would, for example, send K.E.S. videos of his children crying\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fbecause they missed her and her son. On September 23rd, his twins curiously changed their minds\n\nabout a public bowling outing for a private movie session. On September 24th, after K.E.S. told\n\nAppellant he was not welcome at her son’s birthday party, he sent her a video of his young twins\n\nwishing her son a happy birthday.\n\n       These facts, taken together, form favorable evidence supporting the existence of the\n\nproposition Appellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health. Appellant’s\n\nfailure to identify favorable evidence is fatal to his weight of the evidence claim in step four.\n\nHouston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291127\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291127/houston-v-crider/#188\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Houston v. Crider\">317 S.W.3d at 188</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       Third, Appellant marshals a few pieces of evidence contrary to the belief he poses a serious\n\ndanger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health. Appellant notes K.E.S. frequently would block and\n\nunblock Appellant’s phone number. He also contends that despite testifying numerous times she\n\nwas scared of Appellant, K.E.S. continued to date him. He notes K.E.S. never once called the\n\npolice on him. Appellant posits K.E.S. could not have been scared of him because she continued\n\nto voluntarily see him.\n\n        Fourth, Appellant concedes his name calling was “unacceptable” and his pursuit of K.E.S.\n\nwas “aggressive at times.” Still, he argues, his “unacceptable” and “aggressive” behavior lacks\n\nprobative value to support the circuit court’s judgment because it was “reciprocated by [K.E.S.]”\n\nthroughout the relationship as she was willing to “see and go on dates with” him. Except for the\n\nJuly 12th incident, Appellant claims there were “no physical altercations.”\n\n       Appellant paints an incomplete picture of his and K.E.S.’s relationship and engages in\n\nvictim blaming. Section 455.040 protects all victims who can prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence they endured domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault. L.M.M., 619 S.W.3d at 596.\n\nA person does not forfeit the law’s protections just because they failed to immediately cease all\n\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fcommunications with their abuser and engage the legal system. See Parkhurst v. Parkhurst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2376135\"><a href=\"/opinion/2376135/parkhurst-v-parkhurst/#636\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Parkhurst v.

App. E.D. 1990) (granting an order of protection to a person who had last\n\nbeen abused two-and-a-half months before the filing of the petition). Merely showing K.E.S. did\n\nnot respond to Appellant’s abuse as he deemed proper does not demonstrate why the\n\noverwhelming favorable evidence to support the circuit court’s judgment fails to induce a belief\n\nAppellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health.\n\n       Appellant’s analysis also omits evidence his own actions prevented K.E.S. from calling the\n\npolice. She credibly testified he threatened to “blow up” her life with her ex-husband, to use his\n\nlegal connections to avoid criminal charges (as he had in the past), and to call her employer. In\n\naddition, as the circuit court found, K.E.S. took reasonable steps in her handling of the relationship\n\ngiven her understanding of the law. After the physical assault, she met Appellant only in public or\n\nwith his kids. Once she learned about the assault charge against Appellant in Arnold Municipal\n\nCourt, she felt empowered by the legal system. She never again saw Appellant in person. She\n\nwanted to end the relationship without obtaining an order of protection, but Appellant’s incessant\n\nand unwanted contact forced her hand. It would be unfair for Appellant to benefit from her\n\nhesitancy to engage the legal system when he caused her trepidation.\n\n       Appellant’s against the weight challenge fails because he neglected to identify the\n\nfavorable evidence in the record supporting the existence of the proposition he poses a serious\n\ndanger to K.E.S.’s physical or mental health. This Court cannot determine why a proposition lacks\n\nprobative value if the party does not fully identify all favorable evidence supporting that\n\nproposition. Houston, 317 S.W.3d at 188–89. To hold otherwise would require this Court to act as\n\nan advocate for Appellant to demonstrate why the omitted favorable evidence is against the weight\n\nof the evidence.

Lakeshore Estates,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fLLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">636 S.W.3d 622</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (Mo. App. E.D. 2021).

K.E.S. testified Appellant\n\ntold her he had pled guilty to an assault case arising from rape and assault allegations—not just\n\nthat he was charged. Because Appellant offered no rebuttal testimony on this point, and because\n\nthe circuit court found K.E.S. credible, her testimony sufficiently establishes Appellant assaulted\n\na woman in 2005.\n\n       Because Appellant has a history of inflicting or causing physical harm, this factor weighs\n\nin favor of entry of the extended order of protection.\n\n      (c) Appellant’s History of Stalking or Causing Fear of Physical Harm, Bodily Injury,\n                                       or Assault on K.E.S.\n\n       Appellant argues this factor weighs in his favor because the relationship lasted only nine\n\nmonths, he did not contact K.E.S. after she sought an order of protection, there was only one\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fphysical incident between them, and only one incident of assault under § 455.040. Because K.E.S.\n\ncontinued to see him, Appellant posits she could not have feared physical harm from him.\n\n         Appellant’s analysis again minimizes material facts in the record. Appellant concedes there\n\nwas sufficient evidence to support the circuit court’s entry of a full order of protection against him.\n\nThe circuit court found Appellant committed all four acts this factor identifies: stalking, causing\n\nfear of physical harm, bodily injury, and assault. It found he stalked K.E.S. under § 455.040 when\n\nhe broke her bedroom door on April 14th, physically restrained her on July 11th, physically\n\nassaulted her on July 13th, and peered into her windows on July 28th. It also found his incessant\n\ntext messages, especially after K.E.S. told him to stop contacting her, were unwanted and\n\nconstituted stalking.6 The circuit court used those same incidents to prove Appellant caused K.E.S.\n\nto fear physical harm from him. The July 13th incident—when Appellant rammed K.E.S. headfirst\n\nthrough her door, threw her around her living room, and put her in a headlock—is sufficient to\n\nprove bodily injury.7 Finally, the circuit court found Appellant assaulted K.E.S. under § 455.040\n\nbecause of the events of April 14th, July 11th, July 13th, and July 28th, as discussed previously.\n\nAppellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support these findings.\n\n         Because Appellant had a history of stalking, causing fear of physical harm, bodily injury,\n\nand assault on K.E.S., this factor weighs in favor of the entry of the extended order of protection.\n\n                                              (d) Criminal Record\n\n         Appellant argues because K.E.S. did not produce certified copies of his criminal record at\n\nthe hearing, there was no evidence of this factor for the circuit court to consider. K.E.S. contends\n\n\n6\n  Section 455.010(15) defines “stalking” as “when any person purposely engages in an unwanted course of conduct\nthat causes alarm to another person ... when it is reasonable in that person’s situation to have been alarmed by the\nconduct.” “Alarm” means “to cause fear of danger of physical harm.” § 455.010(15)(a). “Course of conduct” means\n“two or more acts that serve no legitimate purpose including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly,\nindirectly, or through a third party follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to a person by\nany action, method, or device.” § 455.010(15)(b).\n7\n  “Battery” is “purposely or knowingly causing physical harm to another ....” § 455.010(1)(c).\n\n\n                                                         16\n\fa screenshot of Case.net, her testimony, and the circuit court’s judicial notice of the Arnold\n\nmunicipal case are adequate to support this factor.\n\n       Because this Court presumes “every clause in a statute has effect, and the legislature did\n\nnot insert superfluous language,” each factor must have an independent meaning. See Dubuc, 659\n\nS.W.3d at 603 (quoting Swafford, 659 S.W.3d at 583). Because this Court must give every clause\n\neffect, it follows “criminal history” and “criminal record” must be afforded different meanings.\n\nThe statute does not define “criminal record.” Webster’s Third defines “record” as “(2) something\n\nthat serves to record, as: … (4) : an official contemporaneous memorandum stating the proceedings\n\nof a court of justice (5) : an official copy of the legal papers used in a case and of memoranda of\n\nthe proceedings of the court.” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT’L DICTIONARY 1898 (2002).\n\nFor purposes of § 455.040.1(4)(d), “criminal record” means official documentation of legal\n\nproceedings. These legal proceedings encompass the entire range of citizen contact with the justice\n\nsystem from arrest to conviction to release. § 610.140.2 (“any person may apply to any court in\n\nwhich such person was charged or found guilty of any offenses, violations, or infractions for an\n\norder to expunge records of such arrest, plea, trial, or conviction.”) (emphasis added); see also\n\n11 C.S.R. § 30-4.010(3) (defining criminal history record information as “identifiable descriptions\n\nand notations of arrests, detentions, indictments, information or other formal criminal charges and\n\nany disposition arising from criminal charges, sentencing, correctional supervision and release.”).\n\n       K.E.S. provided a Case.net screenshot of a 10-count charge for assault, rape, and sodomy\n\nin St. Charles County. “Case.net is not an official record.” Johnson v. McCullough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749324\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749324/johnson-v-mccullough/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Johnson v.

Likewise, K.E.S.’s testimony regarding Appellant’s 2005\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fplea and the St. Charles County case provide no official documentation of legal proceedings. They\n\nare not considered part of his criminal record under § 455.040.1(4)(d).\n\n       Taking judicial notice of official documentation of legal proceedings is permissible to\n\nprove a criminal record.

She argues it would nonetheless\n\nbe unfair not to consider her claim because she did not learn of the dissemination until after the\n\nhearing. It would have been impossible for her to have testified to something she knew nothing\n\nabout. K.E.S. cites no legal authority justifying an exception to this Court’s general rule it “will\n\nnot consider evidence outside the record on appeal.” Day, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5287832\"><a href=\"/opinion/5449031/day-v-hupp/#412\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Day v.

K.E.S. alternatively\n\nargues because Appellant omitted this information in his brief when arguing he never violated the\n\norder of protection, he “opened the door” to correcting this omission. This argument presents a\n\nrule of evidence. Sherrer v. Boston Sci. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">609 S.W.3d 697</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (Mo. banc 2020). This rule of\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fevidence, however, is not an exception to this Court’s general rule. Day, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5287832\"><a href=\"/opinion/5449031/day-v-hupp/#412\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Day v. Hupp\">528 S.W.3d at 412</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nBecause the evidence of Appellant’s alleged dissemination was outside of the record on appeal,\n\nthis Court declines to consider the argument.\n\n       Second, K.E.S. testified Appellant had his “attorney friend” contact her when he was\n\nserved with the ex parte order of protection. K.E.S. argues this contact violated the order of\n\nprotection’s prohibition on third-party contact. This Court need not decide this question. Even\n\nassuming this third-party contact did not result in Appellant violating the order of protection, this\n\nCourt holds factors (a) through (d) provided sufficient evidence Appellant poses a serious danger\n\nto K.E.S.’s physical or mental health.\n\n       For these reasons, the circuit court appropriately applied the factors in § 455.040.1(4)(a)-\n\n(g). The circuit court did not err in finding Appellant poses a serious danger to K.E.S.’s physical\n\nor mental health. The ten-year term for the order of protection is supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nPoint I is denied.\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       The circuit court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                _______________________________\n                                                Philip M.

CASEY FORBES, CLERK\n                            STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA                            SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                                   OF WEST VIRGINIA\n                          SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\n\nIn re B.S.-S. and N.S.\n\nNo. 24-338 (Barbour County CC-01-2022-JA-79 and CC-01-2022-JA-80)\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM DECISION\n\n        Petitioner Mother M.S.-11 appeals the Circuit Court of Barbour County’s May 20, 2024,\norder terminating her parental rights to the children, B.S.-S. and N.S.,2 arguing that the circuit\ncourt erred by denying the petitioner’s motion to continue the dispositional hearing, denying her\nrequest for a post-adjudicatory improvement period, and failing to comply with the time frames\nrequired by Rules 25 and 32 of the West Virginia Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect\nProceedings. Upon our review, we determine that oral argument is unnecessary and that a\nmemorandum decision affirming, in part, and vacating, in part, the circuit court’s September 27,\n2023, and May 20, 2024, orders, and remanding for further proceedings is appropriate, in\naccordance with the “limited circumstances” requirement of Rule 21(d) of the West Virginia Rules\nof Appellate Procedure.\n\n        On November 2, 2022, the DHS filed an abuse and neglect petition alleging that the\npetitioner’s “serious substance abuse addiction and mental health issues” precluded her from\nproperly caring for the children and that she exposed B.S.-S. to domestic violence between herself\nand B.S.-S.’s father, M.S.-2. The DHS further alleged that N.S. lived in Pennsylvania with his\nnonabusing father. According to the record, the petitioner had been living in West Virginia for\n\n\n       1\n        The petitioner appears by counsel Steven B. Nanners. The West Virginia Department of\nHuman Services appears by counsel Attorney General John B. McCuskey and Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Lee Niezgoda. Because a new Attorney General took office while this appeal was pending,\nhis name has been substituted as counsel. Counsel Mary S. Nelson appears as the children’s\nguardian ad litem.\n\n       Additionally, pursuant to West Virginia Code § 5F-2-1a, the agency formerly known as\nthe West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources was terminated. It is now three\nseparate agencies—the Department of Health Facilities, the Department of Health, and the\nDepartment of Human Services. See W. Va. Code § 5F-1-2. For purposes of abuse and neglect\nappeals, the agency is now the Department of Human Services (“DHS”).\n       2\n         We use initials where necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case.\nSee W. Va. R. App. P. 40(e). Because the petitioner and B.S.-S.’s father share the same initials,\nwe refer to them as M.S.-1 and M.S.-2, respectively.\n\n\n                                                1\n\fabout one year when the petition was filed, but she had not had contact with N.S. for several years\nbecause a protective order issued by a Pennsylvania court prohibited her from contacting him.\n\n        At the adjudicatory hearing in February 2023, the petitioner submitted a written stipulation\nadmitting that she failed to properly care for the children because of her mental health issues, drug\nand alcohol addiction, and incidents of domestic violence. She also filed a motion for an\nimprovement period. During questioning by the court, the petitioner explained that she had a\nhistory of addiction to alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine. She admitted that her drug and\nalcohol use negatively impacted her mental health, placed B.S.-S. at risk, and precluded her from\nseeing N.S. The petitioner further admitted that she was involved in one physical altercation with\nM.S.-2 in the presence of B.S.-S. necessitating a response from law enforcement, that M.S.-2 was\nconvicted of domestic battery, and that she filed for a domestic violence protective order.\nNevertheless, she maintained that M.S.-2 was not abusive to her and that she was the aggressor\nduring that incident. The petitioner stated that she was still in a relationship with M.S.-2 and\nintended to remain in a relationship with him. Based on the petitioner’s written stipulation and\ntestimony, the circuit court entered an order on September 27, 2023, finding that N.S. and B.S.-S.\nwere abused and neglected children and adjudicating the petitioner as an abusing and neglectful\nparent. The court found that jurisdiction was “proper” but failed to conduct an analysis pursuant\nto the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”), West Virginia\nCode §§ 48-20-101 to -404. The court held the petitioner’s motion for an improvement period in\nabeyance to give the petitioner “an opportunity to show the Court what she is going to do.” The\ncourt ordered her to drug test as directed, treat her mental health and substance abuse issues,\nundergo a psychological evaluation, and remain drug and alcohol free. Finally, the court\n“admonished the [petitioner] that should she choose to include [M.S.-2] in her life, it [would] effect\nthe breath [sic] and scope of any improvement period.”\n\n        The court held the dispositional hearing on October 31, 2023. At the start of the hearing,\nthe petitioner was absent. The petitioner’s counsel represented to the court that she did not know\nthe petitioner’s whereabouts because she had only communicated with the petitioner twice since\nMay 2022. After a brief recess, the petitioner appeared and requested a continuance of the\ndispositional hearing and a post-dispositional improvement period because she wanted “additional\ntime to show the Court that she [could] comply with what she [was] needing to do.” Specifically,\nthe petitioner asserted that she had “some drug treatment lined up” that she “desired to go to.” The\ncourt denied the petitioner’s request for a continuance finding that the matter had been pending for\na year, which was “a long period of time that [she] could have done better or began addressing the\nissues of abuse and neglect,” and that “it [was] not in the children’s best interests to further\ncontinue the matter.” The court held her motion for a post-dispositional improvement period in\nabeyance and proceeded to hear testimony.\n\n        The petitioner offered conflicting testimony regarding her continued use of drugs and\nalcohol and the status of her relationship with M.S.-2. She admitted to consuming alcohol\nthroughout the proceedings, claimed to have stopped consuming alcohol two months prior, and\ndenied any drug use. She later admitted that she would test positive on a drug screen but refused\nto disclose which substances she had recently used. The petitioner then testified that she was trying\nto “un-mesh” her life from M.S.-2 and moved “two, three houses down” from him, but she\nadmitted that they were still in a relationship and that she continued to pay his rent. The petitioner\n\n                                                  2\n\falso admitted that she failed to submit for drug screens as required and failed to attend her\npsychological evaluation. Finally, the petitioner testified that she should be granted an\nimprovement period because she planned to attend a drug treatment program, that she briefly\nattended a residential treatment program in April 2023, that she participated in counseling, and\nthat she was willing to participate in services. Throughout her testimony, the petitioner refused to\nanswer multiple questions, including how frequently she consumed alcohol or used drugs, whether\nshe participated in services offered by the DHS, and whether she signed releases for the DHS to\nobtain information concerning her residential treatment. The court advised the petitioner that it\nwould make adverse findings that her answers to those questions would have been against her\ninterest.\n\n        The court also heard from a former case worker, who testified that the petitioner’s\nparticipation in the case was minimal and described her as recalcitrant. He explained that although\nthe petitioner completed a detoxification program, attended some multidisciplinary team meetings,\nand may have received treatment at an inpatient facility, she failed to sign releases for the DHS to\nobtain her treatment records, failed to participate in the offered services, and failed to show up for\nher psychological evaluation, which was scheduled three times. He further explained that the\npetitioner had not visited with the children since the commencement of the proceedings because\nshe was not compliant with drug and alcohol testing and declined the DHS’s offer to have “phone\nvisits” with B.S.-S. because “she did not want to create a bond.” During the former case worker’s\ntestimony, the petitioner got up to leave the hearing, exclaimed “[t]hese are lies,” and claimed to\nbe experiencing a panic attack. However, after a brief discussion with the court, she decided to\nstay. Next, the ongoing case worker testified that the petitioner missed 109 of 116 drug screens\nand explained that there were no services the DHS could offer the petitioner to help remediate the\nconditions of abuse and neglect. The petitioner interrupted the ongoing case worker’s testimony\nand requested to be excused from the hearing. After consultation with her attorney and being\nadvised that the hearing would continue in her absence, the petitioner voluntarily left. At the\nconclusion of the testimony, the petitioner’s counsel renewed the petitioner’s motion for a post-\ndispositional improvement period. She argued that the hearing was “overwhelming” for the\npetitioner and stated that the petitioner “desire[d] to get treatment.”\n\n        Ultimately, the circuit court denied the petitioner’s motion for a post-dispositional\nimprovement period and terminated her parental rights to the children. The circuit court observed\nthat the petitioner’s behavior at the hearing was volatile and “illustrative of the problems that ha[d]\noccurred throughout [the] case.” The court found that the petitioner refused to answer critical\nquestions regarding her drug and alcohol use and treatment thereof, that her testimony was not\ncredible, and that she was dishonest about her relationship with M.S.-2. The court also found that\nthe petitioner continued to abuse drugs and alcohol throughout the case and that she was unwilling\n“to participate in services designed to remediate the underlying abuse and neglect.” The court\nnoted that “[a]ny services provided would be for naught” because the petitioner had nearly one\nyear “to show that she [could] make changes or [would] try to change, which she ha[d] not done.”\nBased on those findings, the court determined that the petitioner was unable to solve the conditions\nof abuse and neglect on her own or with help, that she “had not responded to or followed through\nwith the recommended and appropriate treatment,” and that the conditions of abuse and neglect\npersisted. As a result, the circuit court concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that the\nconditions of neglect and abuse could be substantially corrected in the near future and that\n\n                                                  3\n\ftermination of the petitioner’s parental rights was necessary for the children’s welfare.3 It is from\nthe dispositional order that the petitioner appeals.\n\n         On appeal from a final order in an abuse and neglect proceeding, this Court reviews the\ncircuit court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. Syl. Pt. 1, In re\nCecil T., 228 W. Va. 89, 717 S.E.2d 873 (2011). Furthermore, “[w]here the issue on an appeal\nfrom the circuit court is clearly a question of law or involving an interpretation of a statute, we\napply a de novo standard of review.” Syl. Pt. 1, Chrystal R.M. v. Charlie A.L., 194 W. Va. 138,\n459 S.E.2d 415 (1995). As an initial matter, we observe that the circuit court failed to properly\nestablish jurisdiction over N.S. See Syl. Pt. 2, State ex rel. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v.\nWilson, 239 W. Va. 338, 801 S.E.2d 216 (2017) (“This Court, on its own motion, will take notice\nof lack of jurisdiction at any time or at any stage of the litigation pending therein.” (quoting Syl.\nPt. 2, In re Boggs’ Est., 135 W. Va. 288, 63 S.E.2d 497 (1951))). We have held that the UCCJEA\n“is a jurisdictional statute, and the requirements of the statute must be met for a court to have the\npower to adjudicate child custody disputes.” Syl. Pt. 3, In re A.T.-1, 248 W. Va. 484, 889 S.E.2d\n57 (2023) (quoting Syl. Pt. 6, Rosen v. Rosen, 222 W. Va. 402, 664 S.E.2d 743 (2008)).\n\n        To exercise initial jurisdiction over abuse and neglect proceedings that implicate the\nUCCJEA, “a court of this state must satisfy one of the four bases of jurisdiction set forth in [West\nVirginia Code § 48-20-201(a),]” which “have been aptly summarized as 1) ‘home state’\njurisdiction; 2) ‘significant connection’ jurisdiction; 3) ‘jurisdiction because of declination of\njurisdiction’; and 4) ‘default’ jurisdiction.” In re Z.H., 245 W. Va. 456, 464, 859 S.E.2d 399, 407\n(2021) (citing In re J.C., 242 W. Va. 165, 171, 832 S.E.2d 91, 97 (2019)). Importantly, “[t]hese\njurisdictional bases do not operate alternatively to each other, but rather, in order of priority—\nreaching the next basis of jurisdiction only if the preceding basis does not resolve the jurisdictional\nissue.” Id. In In re Z.H., this Court explained that “home state” jurisdiction is conferred upon a\nWest Virginia court if West Virginia is the child’s home state “on the date of the commencement\nof the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement\nof the proceeding, and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent\ncontinues to live in this state.” 245 W. Va. at 464, 859 S.E.2d at 407 (quoting W. Va. Code § 48-\n20-201(a)(1)). Further, the term “home state”\n\n       means the state in which the child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent\n       for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a\n       child custody proceeding . . . . A period of temporary absence of any of the\n       mentioned persons is part of the period.\n\nIn re Z.H., 245 W. Va. at 464, 859 S.E.2d at 407 (quoting Syl. Pt. 3, Rosen v. Rosen, 222 W. Va.\n402, 404, 664 S.E.2d 743, 745 (2008)). When a court of another state has “home state” jurisdiction\nover a child, a West Virginia court may nevertheless have jurisdiction by meeting the requirements\nof “significant connection” jurisdiction. West Virginia Code § 48-20-201(a)(2) provides, in\n\n\n       3\n         The court also terminated the parental rights of B.S.-S.’s father. The permanency plan for\nB.S.-S. is adoption in his current placement. The permanency plan for N.S. is to remain with his\nnonabusing father.\n\n\n                                                  4\n\frelevant part, that a court has “significant connection jurisdiction” when “a court of the home state\nof the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this state is the more appropriate\nforum under section 20-207 or 20-208.” See Syl. Pt. 4, In re J.C., 242 W. Va. 165, 832 S.E.2d 91\n(holding that the declination of jurisdiction by the home state court “is not satisfied by evidence\nthat some other person or entity in the child’s home state declined jurisdiction”).\n\n        Here, the record establishes that N.S. had lived with his father in Pennsylvania for several\nyears prior to the commencement of the abuse and neglect proceedings.4 Thus, Pennsylvania was\nN.S.’s home state, and the circuit court did not have “home state” jurisdiction over him. Moreover,\nthere is nothing in the record indicating that a court in Pennsylvania declined to exercise\njurisdiction. Therefore, the circuit court also did not have “substantial connection” jurisdiction\nover N.S. Because Pennsylvania had “home state” jurisdiction over N.S. and no court in\nPennsylvania declined to exercise jurisdiction, the circuit court could not have “declination” or\n“default” jurisdiction over N.S. See W. Va. Code § 48-20-201(a)(3)-(4) (providing that a circuit\ncourt could obtain jurisdiction when “[a]ll courts having jurisdiction under subdivision (1) or (2)\nof this subdivision have declined to exercise jurisdiction” or “[n]o court of any other state would\nhave jurisdiction under the criteria specified in subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection”).\n\n          In addition, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over N.S. because he was not “an\n‘abused child’ or a ‘neglected child’ as those terms are defined in West Virginia Code § 49-1-201.”\nSyl. Pt. 2, In re B.V., 248 W. Va. 29, 886 S.E.2d 364 (2023). West Virginia Code § 49-1-201\ndefines “[a]bused child” as “[a] child whose health or welfare is being harmed or threatened by[ ]\n. . . [a] parent, guardian, or custodian who knowingly or intentionally inflicts, attempts to inflict,\nor knowingly allows another person to inflict, physical injury or mental or emotional injury, upon\nthe child or another child in the home.” A “[n]eglected child” is defined as one whose “physical\nor mental health” is “harmed or threatened by a present refusal, failure or inability of the child’s\nparent, guardian, or custodian to supply the child with necessary food, clothing, shelter,\nsupervision, medical care, or education[.]” Id. Further, West Virginia Code § 49-4-601(i) requires\nthat abuse or neglect must be established based upon “conditions existing at the time of the filing\nof the petition and proven by clear and convincing evidence.” See also Syl. Pt, 8, in part, In re\nC.S., 247 W. Va. 212, 875 S.E.2d 350 (2022) (holding that “a circuit court’s finding that a child is\nan ‘abused child’ or a ‘neglected child’ must be based upon the conditions existing at the time of\nthe filing of the abuse and neglect petition”). At the time the petition was filed, N.S. was residing\nin Pennsylvania with his father, the petitioner had not had any contact with N.S. for several years,\nand a protective order was in effect preventing the petitioner from contacting N.S. As such, N.S.\nwas not subject to the petitioner’s abusive and neglectful behavior, and there was no evidence\nadduced below indicating that either N.S.’s health or welfare were threatened by the petitioner.\nTherefore, despite the petitioner’s stipulation that she failed to properly care for the children\nbecause of her mental health issues, drug and alcohol addiction, and incidents of domestic\n\n\n       4\n          We, again, remind circuit courts that they “must be watchful for jurisdictional issues\narising under the [UCCJEA] . . . . Even if not raised by a party, if there is any question regarding\na lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the UCCJEA then the court should sua sponte address\nthe issue as early in the proceeding as possible.” In re Z.H., 245 W. Va. at 459, 859 S.E.2d at 402,\nSyl. Pt. 5, in part.\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fviolence, there was no admission by the petitioner or any specific finding by the circuit court in its\nadjudicatory order explaining how those conditions resulted in the abuse or neglect of N.S. As\nsuch, we must vacate, in part, the circuit court’s September 27, 2023, order adjudicating the\npetitioner as an abusing parent as it pertains to N.S. Likewise, we must vacate, in part, the circuit\ncourt’s May 20, 2024, order terminating the petitioner’s parental rights only as it pertains to N.S.\n\n        Turning to the petitioner’s assignments of error as they relate to B.S.-S., she argues that\nthe circuit court erred in denying her motion to continue the dispositional hearing. The petitioner\ncontends that the court’s reasoning for denying her motion was “improper and flawed” and\n“effectively denied her a meaningful hearing.” While the petitioner is correct that she was entitled\nto a meaningful opportunity to be heard, we disagree that the circuit court denied her this\nopportunity by refusing her motion to continue. See W. Va. Code § 49-4-601(h) (“[T]he party or\nparties having custodial or other parental rights or responsibilities to the child shall be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard, including the opportunity to testify and to present and cross-\nexamine witnesses.”). Likewise, we discern no abuse of discretion in the court’s denial of a\ncontinuance. It is in the circuit court’s discretion to decide whether a continuance of a proceeding\nis warranted. See In re Tiffany Marie S., 196 W. Va. 223, 235, 470 S.E.2d 177, 189 (“Whether a\nparty should be granted a continuance for fairness reasons is a matter left to the discretion of the\ncircuit court, and a reviewing court plays a limited and restricted role in overseeing the circuit\ncourt’s exercise of that discretion.”). In abuse and neglect cases, we have recognized that “abuse\ncan be found in the denial of a continuance only when it can be seen as ‘an unreasoning and\narbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay[.]’” Id. at\n236, 470 S.E.2d at 190 (quoting Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11–12 (1983) (citation omitted)).\n\n        Here, the circuit court’s refusal to continue the hearing was neither unreasonable nor\narbitrary as there is nothing in the record showing good cause for a continuation. The basis for the\npetitioner’s continuance was to give her “additional time to show the Court that she [could] comply\nwith what she [was] needing to do.” However, the record indicates that the petitioner had nearly\none year to make such a showing but was noncompliant with almost all aspects of the case. The\npetitioner’s last-minute assertion that she was planning to seek treatment for her drug and alcohol\naddiction was not sufficient to justify her request to delay B.S.-S.’s permanency. See Syl. Pt. 1, in\npart, In Interest of Carlita B., 185 W. Va. 613, 408 S.E.2d 365 (1991) (“Unjustified procedural\ndelays wreak havoc on a child’s development, stability and security.”). Moreover, the petitioner\nwas given the opportunity to present and cross-examine witnesses at the dispositional hearing.\nThus, she was not denied her right to be heard. Accordingly, we discern no error in the circuit\ncourt’s denial of the petitioner’s request to continue the dispositional hearing.\n\n        The petitioner next argues that the circuit court erred in denying her an improvement period\nbecause she demonstrated that she would comply with the terms thereof. We disagree. West\nVirginia Code § 49-4-610 permits the circuit court to grant an improvement period when a parent\n“demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the [parent] is likely to fully participate in\nthe improvement period.” However, “[t]he circuit court has the discretion to refuse to grant an\nimprovement period when no improvement is likely.” In re Tonjia M., 212 W. Va. 443, 448, 573\nS.E.2d 354, 359 (2002). The evidence presented at the dispositional hearing supported the circuit\ncourt’s finding that improvement was not likely. Over the course of the proceedings, the petitioner\nmissed nearly all of her drug screens, failed to appear for her psychological evaluation three times,\n\n                                                  6\n\fand continued to associate with M.S.-2. Further, the petitioner forfeited visitations with B.S.-S.\nbecause she refused to submit to drug screens and continued to abuse drugs and alcohol, and she\ndeclined the DHS’s offer to have “phone visits” with B.S.-S. As we have previously explained,\n“the level of interest demonstrated by a parent in visiting his or her children while they are out of\nthe parent’s custody is a significant factor in determining the parent’s potential to improve\nsufficiently and achieve minimum standards to parent the child.” In re Katie S., 198 W. Va. 79, 90\nn.14, 479 S.E.2d 589, 600 n.14 (1996) (citations omitted). Therefore, we discern no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court’s refusal to grant the petitioner an improvement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the circuit court’s decision to terminate the petitioner’s\nparental rights to B.S.-S. The circuit court found that termination was in the best interest of B.S.-S.\nand that there was no reasonable likelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect could be\ncorrected in the near future. For the same reasons discussed above, these findings were well\nsupported by the record. See W. Va. Code § 49-4-604(c)(6) (permitting circuit court to terminate\nparental rights upon finding no reasonable likelihood conditions of neglect can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future and when necessary for the child’s welfare).\n\n        Finally, the petitioner argues that the circuit court erred by failing to comply with the time\nframes required by Rules 25 and 32 of the West Virginia Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and\nNeglect Proceedings.5 We acknowledge that the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings were held\noutside of the applicable timeframes. In In re J.G., II, 240 W. Va. 194, 205, 809 S.E.2d 459, 464\n(2018), we explained that “[t]he time limitations and standards contained [within Chapter 49 of\nthe West Virginia Code, the Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings, and our\nextensive body of caselaw] are mandatory and may not be casually disregarded or enlarged without\ndetailed findings demonstrating exercise of clear-cut statutory authority.” Moreover, we have\nexplained on numerous occasions that “the best interests of the child is the polar star by which\ndecisions must be made which affect children.” Michael K.T. v. Tina L.T., 182 W. Va. 399, 405,\n387 S.E.2d 866, 872 (1989). As such, “a mere procedural technicality does not take precedence\nover the best interests of the children.” In re Tyler D., 213 W. Va. 149, 160, 578 S.E.2d 343, 354\n(2003). After a thorough review of the record, the termination of the petitioner’s parental rights is\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, vacating the adjudicatory and dispositional\norders and remanding the matter for compliance with long-expired time frames would serve no\npurpose other than to further delay permanency for B.S.-S. Accordingly, we find no reversible\nerror as it relates to B.S.-S.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we vacate, in part, the circuit court’s September 27, 2023,\nadjudicatory order as it relates to N.S.; vacate, in part, the May 20, 2024, dispositional order\nterminating the petitioner’s parental rights to N.S.; and remand this matter to the circuit court for\nfurther proceedings, including but not limited to, communication with the appropriate\n\n\n       5\n             Rule 25 provides that “[w]hen a child is placed in the temporary custody of the [DHS]\n. . ., the final adjudicatory hearing shall commence within thirty (30) days of the temporary custody\norder entered following the preliminary hearing . . . unless a preadjudicatory improvement period\nhas been ordered.” Rule 32 provides that “[t]he disposition hearing shall commence within forty-\nfive (45) days of the entry of the final adjudicatory order unless an improvement period is granted\n. . . and then no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the improvement period.”\n                                                  7\n\fPennsylvania court and the entry of an order setting forth the necessary findings as to whether N.S.\nmeets the statutory definitions of an abused or neglected child.6 See W. Va. Code § 49-1-201. The\ncircuit court is further directed to undertake any additional proceedings consistent with the\napplicable rules and statutes. With respect to B.S.-S., the circuit court’s September 27, 2023,\nadjudicatory order and May 20, 2024, dispositional orders are affirmed. The Clerk is hereby\ndirected to issue the mandate contemporaneously herewith.\n\n                                Affirmed, in part; vacated, in part; and remanded, with directions.\n\n\nISSUED: July 30, 2025\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice William R.

CASEY FORBES, CLERK\n                            STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA                            SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                                   OF WEST VIRGINIA\n                          SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\n\nIn re B.S.-S. and N.S.\n\nNo. 24-338 (Barbour County CC-01-2022-JA-79 and CC-01-2022-JA-80)\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM DECISION\n\n        Petitioner Mother M.S.-11 appeals the Circuit Court of Barbour County’s May 20, 2024,\norder terminating her parental rights to the children, B.S.-S. and N.S.,2 arguing that the circuit\ncourt erred by denying the petitioner’s motion to continue the dispositional hearing, denying her\nrequest for a post-adjudicatory improvement period, and failing to comply with the time frames\nrequired by Rules 25 and 32 of the West Virginia Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect\nProceedings. Upon our review, we determine that oral argument is unnecessary and that a\nmemorandum decision affirming, in part, and vacating, in part, the circuit court’s September 27,\n2023, and May 20, 2024, orders, and remanding for further proceedings is appropriate, in\naccordance with the “limited circumstances” requirement of Rule 21(d) of the West Virginia Rules\nof Appellate Procedure.\n\n        On November 2, 2022, the DHS filed an abuse and neglect petition alleging that the\npetitioner’s “serious substance abuse addiction and mental health issues” precluded her from\nproperly caring for the children and that she exposed B.S.-S. to domestic violence between herself\nand B.S.-S.’s father, M.S.-2. The DHS further alleged that N.S. lived in Pennsylvania with his\nnonabusing father. According to the record, the petitioner had been living in West Virginia for\n\n\n       1\n        The petitioner appears by counsel Steven B. Nanners. The West Virginia Department of\nHuman Services appears by counsel Attorney General John B. McCuskey and Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Lee Niezgoda. Because a new Attorney General took office while this appeal was pending,\nhis name has been substituted as counsel. Counsel Mary S. Nelson appears as the children’s\nguardian ad litem.\n\n       Additionally, pursuant to West Virginia Code § 5F-2-1a, the agency formerly known as\nthe West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources was terminated. It is now three\nseparate agencies—the Department of Health Facilities, the Department of Health, and the\nDepartment of Human Services. See W. Va. Code § 5F-1-2. For purposes of abuse and neglect\nappeals, the agency is now the Department of Human Services (“DHS”).\n       2\n         We use initials where necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case.\nSee W. Va. R. App. P. 40(e). Because the petitioner and B.S.-S.’s father share the same initials,\nwe refer to them as M.S.-1 and M.S.-2, respectively.\n\n\n                                                1\n\fabout one year when the petition was filed, but she had not had contact with N.S. for several years\nbecause a protective order issued by a Pennsylvania court prohibited her from contacting him.\n\n        At the adjudicatory hearing in February 2023, the petitioner submitted a written stipulation\nadmitting that she failed to properly care for the children because of her mental health issues, drug\nand alcohol addiction, and incidents of domestic violence. She also filed a motion for an\nimprovement period. During questioning by the court, the petitioner explained that she had a\nhistory of addiction to alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine. She admitted that her drug and\nalcohol use negatively impacted her mental health, placed B.S.-S. at risk, and precluded her from\nseeing N.S. The petitioner further admitted that she was involved in one physical altercation with\nM.S.-2 in the presence of B.S.-S. necessitating a response from law enforcement, that M.S.-2 was\nconvicted of domestic battery, and that she filed for a domestic violence protective order.\nNevertheless, she maintained that M.S.-2 was not abusive to her and that she was the aggressor\nduring that incident. The petitioner stated that she was still in a relationship with M.S.-2 and\nintended to remain in a relationship with him. Based on the petitioner’s written stipulation and\ntestimony, the circuit court entered an order on September 27, 2023, finding that N.S. and B.S.-S.\nwere abused and neglected children and adjudicating the petitioner as an abusing and neglectful\nparent. The court found that jurisdiction was “proper” but failed to conduct an analysis pursuant\nto the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”), West Virginia\nCode §§ 48-20-101 to -404. The court held the petitioner’s motion for an improvement period in\nabeyance to give the petitioner “an opportunity to show the Court what she is going to do.” The\ncourt ordered her to drug test as directed, treat her mental health and substance abuse issues,\nundergo a psychological evaluation, and remain drug and alcohol free. Finally, the court\n“admonished the [petitioner] that should she choose to include [M.S.-2] in her life, it [would] effect\nthe breath [sic] and scope of any improvement period.”\n\n        The court held the dispositional hearing on October 31, 2023. At the start of the hearing,\nthe petitioner was absent. The petitioner’s counsel represented to the court that she did not know\nthe petitioner’s whereabouts because she had only communicated with the petitioner twice since\nMay 2022. After a brief recess, the petitioner appeared and requested a continuance of the\ndispositional hearing and a post-dispositional improvement period because she wanted “additional\ntime to show the Court that she [could] comply with what she [was] needing to do.” Specifically,\nthe petitioner asserted that she had “some drug treatment lined up” that she “desired to go to.” The\ncourt denied the petitioner’s request for a continuance finding that the matter had been pending for\na year, which was “a long period of time that [she] could have done better or began addressing the\nissues of abuse and neglect,” and that “it [was] not in the children’s best interests to further\ncontinue the matter.” The court held her motion for a post-dispositional improvement period in\nabeyance and proceeded to hear testimony.\n\n        The petitioner offered conflicting testimony regarding her continued use of drugs and\nalcohol and the status of her relationship with M.S.-2. She admitted to consuming alcohol\nthroughout the proceedings, claimed to have stopped consuming alcohol two months prior, and\ndenied any drug use. She later admitted that she would test positive on a drug screen but refused\nto disclose which substances she had recently used. The petitioner then testified that she was trying\nto “un-mesh” her life from M.S.-2 and moved “two, three houses down” from him, but she\nadmitted that they were still in a relationship and that she continued to pay his rent. The petitioner\n\n                                                  2\n\falso admitted that she failed to submit for drug screens as required and failed to attend her\npsychological evaluation. Finally, the petitioner testified that she should be granted an\nimprovement period because she planned to attend a drug treatment program, that she briefly\nattended a residential treatment program in April 2023, that she participated in counseling, and\nthat she was willing to participate in services. Throughout her testimony, the petitioner refused to\nanswer multiple questions, including how frequently she consumed alcohol or used drugs, whether\nshe participated in services offered by the DHS, and whether she signed releases for the DHS to\nobtain information concerning her residential treatment. The court advised the petitioner that it\nwould make adverse findings that her answers to those questions would have been against her\ninterest.\n\n        The court also heard from a former case worker, who testified that the petitioner’s\nparticipation in the case was minimal and described her as recalcitrant. He explained that although\nthe petitioner completed a detoxification program, attended some multidisciplinary team meetings,\nand may have received treatment at an inpatient facility, she failed to sign releases for the DHS to\nobtain her treatment records, failed to participate in the offered services, and failed to show up for\nher psychological evaluation, which was scheduled three times. He further explained that the\npetitioner had not visited with the children since the commencement of the proceedings because\nshe was not compliant with drug and alcohol testing and declined the DHS’s offer to have “phone\nvisits” with B.S.-S. because “she did not want to create a bond.” During the former case worker’s\ntestimony, the petitioner got up to leave the hearing, exclaimed “[t]hese are lies,” and claimed to\nbe experiencing a panic attack. However, after a brief discussion with the court, she decided to\nstay. Next, the ongoing case worker testified that the petitioner missed 109 of 116 drug screens\nand explained that there were no services the DHS could offer the petitioner to help remediate the\nconditions of abuse and neglect. The petitioner interrupted the ongoing case worker’s testimony\nand requested to be excused from the hearing. After consultation with her attorney and being\nadvised that the hearing would continue in her absence, the petitioner voluntarily left. At the\nconclusion of the testimony, the petitioner’s counsel renewed the petitioner’s motion for a post-\ndispositional improvement period. She argued that the hearing was “overwhelming” for the\npetitioner and stated that the petitioner “desire[d] to get treatment.”\n\n        Ultimately, the circuit court denied the petitioner’s motion for a post-dispositional\nimprovement period and terminated her parental rights to the children. The circuit court observed\nthat the petitioner’s behavior at the hearing was volatile and “illustrative of the problems that ha[d]\noccurred throughout [the] case.” The court found that the petitioner refused to answer critical\nquestions regarding her drug and alcohol use and treatment thereof, that her testimony was not\ncredible, and that she was dishonest about her relationship with M.S.-2. The court also found that\nthe petitioner continued to abuse drugs and alcohol throughout the case and that she was unwilling\n“to participate in services designed to remediate the underlying abuse and neglect.” The court\nnoted that “[a]ny services provided would be for naught” because the petitioner had nearly one\nyear “to show that she [could] make changes or [would] try to change, which she ha[d] not done.”\nBased on those findings, the court determined that the petitioner was unable to solve the conditions\nof abuse and neglect on her own or with help, that she “had not responded to or followed through\nwith the recommended and appropriate treatment,” and that the conditions of abuse and neglect\npersisted. As a result, the circuit court concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that the\nconditions of neglect and abuse could be substantially corrected in the near future and that\n\n                                                  3\n\ftermination of the petitioner’s parental rights was necessary for the children’s welfare.3 It is from\nthe dispositional order that the petitioner appeals.\n\n         On appeal from a final order in an abuse and neglect proceeding, this Court reviews the\ncircuit court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.

Moreover,\nthere is nothing in the record indicating that a court in Pennsylvania declined to exercise\njurisdiction. Therefore, the circuit court also did not have “substantial connection” jurisdiction\nover N.S. Because Pennsylvania had “home state” jurisdiction over N.S. and no court in\nPennsylvania declined to exercise jurisdiction, the circuit court could not have “declination” or\n“default” jurisdiction over N.S.

Further, West Virginia Code § 49-4-601(i) requires\nthat abuse or neglect must be established based upon “conditions existing at the time of the filing\nof the petition and proven by clear and convincing evidence.” See also Syl.

Likewise, we must vacate, in part, the circuit\ncourt’s May 20, 2024, order terminating the petitioner’s parental rights only as it pertains to N.S.\n\n        Turning to the petitioner’s assignments of error as they relate to B.S.-S., she argues that\nthe circuit court erred in denying her motion to continue the dispositional hearing. The petitioner\ncontends that the court’s reasoning for denying her motion was “improper and flawed” and\n“effectively denied her a meaningful hearing.” While the petitioner is correct that she was entitled\nto a meaningful opportunity to be heard, we disagree that the circuit court denied her this\nopportunity by refusing her motion to continue.

The basis for the\npetitioner’s continuance was to give her “additional time to show the Court that she [could] comply\nwith what she [was] needing to do.” However, the record indicates that the petitioner had nearly\none year to make such a showing but was noncompliant with almost all aspects of the case. The\npetitioner’s last-minute assertion that she was planning to seek treatment for her drug and alcohol\naddiction was not sufficient to justify her request to delay B.S.-S.’s permanency. See Syl.

Accordingly, we discern no error in the circuit\ncourt’s denial of the petitioner’s request to continue the dispositional hearing.\n\n        The petitioner next argues that the circuit court erred in denying her an improvement period\nbecause she demonstrated that she would comply with the terms thereof. We disagree. West\nVirginia Code § 49-4-610 permits the circuit court to grant an improvement period when a parent\n“demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the [parent] is likely to fully participate in\nthe improvement period.” However, “[t]he circuit court has the discretion to refuse to grant an\nimprovement period when no improvement is likely.” In re Tonjia M., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8182168\"><a href=\"/opinion/8218937/in-re-tonjia-m/#448\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re Tonjia M.\">212 W.

Further, the petitioner forfeited visitations with B.S.-S.\nbecause she refused to submit to drug screens and continued to abuse drugs and alcohol, and she\ndeclined the DHS’s offer to have “phone visits” with B.S.-S. As we have previously explained,\n“the level of interest demonstrated by a parent in visiting his or her children while they are out of\nthe parent’s custody is a significant factor in determining the parent’s potential to improve\nsufficiently and achieve minimum standards to parent the child.” In re Katie S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1374294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1374294/in-re-katie-s/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In Re Katie S.\">198 W.

The circuit court found that termination was in the best interest of B.S.-S.\nand that there was no reasonable likelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect could be\ncorrected in the near future.

The juvenile court terminated their parental rights under Iowa Code\n\nsection 232.116(1)(e), (f), and (h) (2023).    On appeal, the father purports to\n\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting those grounds. The mother\n\nclaims the court “should have found that the children could be safely reunified with\n\n[her] or, in the alternative, that continued deferral of permanency would be\n\nappropriate to allow [her] to continue to work toward reunification.” Upon our de\n\nnovo review of the record,1 we affirm.\n\n      Starting with the father’s appeal, while the sole issue heading in his petition\n\non appeal contests the grounds for termination, he only argues the children could\n\nhave been returned to the mother if she was given more time. That is not a\n\nchallenge to any of the grounds for termination as they relate to the father. See In\n\nre D.G., 704 N.W.2d 454, 459 (Iowa Ct. App. 2005) (“[I]n termination of parental\n\nrights proceedings each parent’s parental rights are separate adjudications, both\n\nfactually and legally.”). And the father lacks standing to challenge termination of\n\nthe mother’s parental rights or make arguments on her behalf. See, e.g., In re\n\n\n\n\n1  We review termination proceedings de novo.             See In re L.B., 970\nN.W.2d 311, 313 (Iowa 2022). “The burden is on the State to show by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the requirements for termination have been satisfied.” Id.\nAlthough we normally apply a three-step analysis in conducting our review, we only\naddress the steps raised by the parents on appeal. See id. If those steps support\ntermination, we consider any ancillary issues raised by the parents.\n\f                                         3\n\n\nJ.H., 952 N.W.2d 157, 171 (Iowa 2020); In re K.R., 737 N.W.2d 321, 323 (Iowa Ct.\n\nApp. 2007). So we do not consider his claim further.\n\n       Moving on to the mother’s appeal, we interpret the reunification component\n\nof her argument as a claim that the children could have been returned to her\n\ncustody at the time of the termination hearing. But that argument only implicates\n\ntermination under section 232.116(1)(f) and (h), not section 232.116(1)(e). We\n\ncould summarily affirm on this unchallenged ground.          See, e.g., In re Q.B.,\n\nNo. 23-2112, 2024 WL 707194, at *1 (Iowa Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2024) (affirming\n\ntermination under paragraph (e) as an unchallenged ground because mother’s\n\nclaim that child could be returned to her custody did not implicate that ground for\n\ntermination).\n\n       Still, we choose to address termination under paragraphs (f) and (h). In\n\narguing that reunification could have occurred at the termination hearing, as\n\nrequired by the fourth element of those paragraphs, the mother claims she\n\n“reengaged in some amount of mental health counseling,” she “had completed a\n\nseries of independent [urinalysis tests] to show sobriety,” and “there were not\n\nongoing concerns of domestic violence . . . as the father was incarcerated and\n\nthere was a no-contact order preventing him from being in the presence of the\n\nchildren.”      See Iowa Code § 232.116(1)(f)(4), (h)(4); In re D.W., 791\n\nN.W.2d 703, 707 (Iowa 2010) (interpreting “present time” to mean “the time of the\n\ntermination hearing”). This is a rose-colored view of the facts, to say the least.\n\n       The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services first became involved\n\nwith the family in May 2020 after the father assaulted the mother in front of the two\n\noldest children. While being treated at the hospital for her injuries, the mother\n\f                                         4\n\n\ntested positive for amphetamines, and she admitted to recent methamphetamine\n\nuse. The father was arrested and charged with multiple crimes for the assault. A\n\nno-contact order was entered in June (even though one was already in effect at\n\nthe time of the assault) prohibiting the father from having contact with the mother\n\nor the children. The two children were later removed from the mother’s custody\n\nand adjudicated in need of assistance. They were eventually returned to the\n\nmother’s custody, and the case closed in April 2022.\n\n       Just three months later, the department learned the mother tested positive\n\nfor methamphetamine at a doctor’s appointment. She was twenty-seven weeks\n\npregnant with her third child with the father.2     The department launched an\n\ninvestigation and found the father in the family home. He was arrested for violating\n\nthe no-contact order still in effect. The mother agreed to allow the maternal\n\ngrandmother, who lived in Arkansas, to care for the children. A few weeks later,\n\nthe mother assaulted the grandmother and fled with the children. They were found\n\nat a motel in Iowa in early September. The two children were removed from the\n\nmother’s custody, and one of them tested positive for methamphetamine. They\n\nwere adjudicated in need of assistance later that month.\n\n       The mother entered inpatient treatment for her substance use in late\n\nSeptember.    She tested positive for methamphetamine at admission.            The\n\nyoungest child was born a few weeks later. The State filed a child-in-need-of-\n\nassistance petition for him in October, although he was allowed to stay with the\n\n\n2 Besides the three children at issue here, the mother has five older children with\n\nother men. Her parental rights to three of those children were terminated, two in\nNew York and one in Arkansas. She gave a fourth child up for adoption at birth.\nAnd a fifth child is in the full custody of that child’s father in another state.\n\f                                            5\n\n\nmother at her treatment facility. But after the mother failed to take the infant for\n\nmedical appointments that were required because of his low weight, the State\n\nobtained an order for his temporary removal. The mother was arrested on a\n\nwarrant later that month.       The youngest child was adjudicated in need of\n\nassistance in November. Once she was released from jail, the mother returned to\n\ninpatient treatment. But she left in January 2023 after instigating a fight with other\n\nresidents. It has been a downward spiral for the mother since then.\n\n       The mother was homeless and unemployed for several months, bouncing\n\n“all over the place,” from Charles City, to Waterloo, to Fort Dodge. With the\n\ndepartment’s help, she eventually obtained housing. But she has never held a job.\n\nThe mother’s participation in substance-use treatment was sporadic, and she no-\n\nshowed for almost every drug test the department requested. The mother finally\n\nstarted some mental-health counseling in May, after her in-person visits with the\n\nchildren were suspended because of her behavior.3 Even though the counseling\n\nappointments were virtual, the mother’s attendance was inconsistent. And her\n\nmental health was deteriorating.\n\n       Starting in late July, the mother posted a series of homicidal and suicidal\n\nmessages on social media. She also sent providers threatening text messages.\n\nBecause of her threats, the department assigned two case managers to the family.\n\n\n\n3 At an April visit, the mother threatened to kill herself in front of the children, which\n\ncaused the older two “to be very emotionally disturbed, upset, and distraught.”\nDuring some earlier visits, she told the children things like the department was\n“mean to her,” they have “to be good” or they would “never come home,” and “she\ndoes not do drugs and that [the department] is lying.” The children had severe\nbehavioral issues after these visits, including hitting other children and threatening\nto harm themselves. Those issues resolved after in-person visits stopped.\n\f                                         6\n\n\nAs the juvenile court observed in a permanency order that month, the mother could\n\nnot “control her anger long enough to sit through a court hearing”—“she became\n\nagitated and was talking over people, used vulgar language, and was derogatory”\n\nto the court “and everyone participating in the case.” The mother was unable to\n\nresume in-person visits with the children, though she did have virtual interactions\n\nwith them. Yet even those were problematic. The State petitioned to terminate\n\nthe parents’ rights in September. At the hearing in December, which the mother\n\ndid not attend, a case manager testified the children could not be returned to the\n\nmother—then or within a reasonable time. She pointed to long-standing and\n\nunresolved concerns with the mother’s substance use, mental health, continued\n\nrelationship with the father, and inappropriate behavior. Put simply, the case was\n\nplagued by the mother’s belligerent hostility toward the professionals trying to help\n\nher reunite with her children and her clearly unstable mental health.\n\n       Against this backdrop, the mother’s engagement in “some amount of mental\n\nhealth counseling” was not sufficient to allow a return of custody. See In re D.H.,\n\nNo. 18-1552, 2019 WL 156668, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2019) (concluding a\n\nmother’s “failure to seek treatment for her mental-health conditions supports\n\ntermination of her parental rights”).   As for the mother’s sobriety, she tested\n\npositive for methamphetamine multiple times early in the proceedings. Then she\n\nrefused drug testing through the department altogether.           See In re C.A.,\n\nNo. 23-0746, 2023 WL 5092843, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2023) (presuming a\n\nparent’s “numerous no-shows for testing would have returned positive results”).\n\nLike the juvenile court, we put “no faith” in the at-home drug tests the mother\n\nstarted taking before the termination hearing. On this record, we can only conclude\n\f                                         7\n\n\nthat the mother remains in the throes of addiction, just as she remains enmeshed\n\nin her relationship with the father. They continued to have contact with one another\n\ndespite multiple no-contact orders, criminal consequences, and juvenile court\n\ninvolvement. With this unfiltered view of the facts, we agree with the court that the\n\nchildren couldn’t be returned to the mother’s custody at the termination hearing.\n\nSee In re T.S., 868 N.W.2d 425, 435 (Iowa Ct. App. 2015) (citing mother’s\n\nmethamphetamine abuse and violent relationship as reasons that returning child\n\nto her custody would be contrary to his welfare).\n\n       Turning to the second part of the mother’s argument, she has failed to\n\nenumerate any “specific factors, conditions, or expected behavioral changes” that\n\nwould warrant an extension on her behalf. See Iowa Code § 232.104(2)(b). It’s\n\nnot our role to do so for her. See In re A.H., No. 20-1660, 2021 WL 1399743, at *4\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2021); accord Inghram v. Dairyland Mut. Ins. Co., 215\n\nN.W.2d 239, 240 (Iowa 1974).         In any event, looking at the mother’s past\n\nperformance—which includes years of services and a failed reunification—“we are\n\nnot convinced additional time or services will change” her. See In re L.L., 459\n\nN.W.2d 489, 495 (Iowa 1990). So we conclude additional time is unwarranted,\n\nand we affirm the termination of the mother’s parental rights.4\n\n       AFFIRMED ON BOTH APPEALS.\n\n\n4 In passing, the mother also complains that the children “were not all placed\n\ntogether” in one concurrent home at the time of termination. While there is “a\npreference to keep siblings together,” the “preference is not absolute” and must\ngive way to the children’s best interests. In re J.E., 723 N.W.2d 793, 800\n(Iowa 2006). Although the oldest child is in a separate home from his two siblings,\nall three are thriving. They are bonded with their foster families, who facilitate\ncontact between the siblings, and the oldest two want to stay where they’re at. We\nconclude maintaining these stable placements is in the children’s best interests.\n\f",

The juvenile court terminated their parental rights under Iowa Code\n\nsection 232.116(1)(e), (f), and (h) (2023).    On appeal, the father purports to\n\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting those grounds. The mother\n\nclaims the court “should have found that the children could be safely reunified with\n\n[her] or, in the alternative, that continued deferral of permanency would be\n\nappropriate to allow [her] to continue to work toward reunification.” Upon our de\n\nnovo review of the record,1 we affirm.\n\n      Starting with the father’s appeal, while the sole issue heading in his petition\n\non appeal contests the grounds for termination, he only argues the children could\n\nhave been returned to the mother if she was given more time. That is not a\n\nchallenge to any of the grounds for termination as they relate to the father. See In\n\nre D.G., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8244952\"><a href=\"/opinion/8279580/in-the-interest-of-dg/#459\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In the Interest of D.G.\">704 N.W.2d 454, 459</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa Ct. App. 2005) (“[I]n termination of parental\n\nrights proceedings each parent’s parental rights are separate adjudications, both\n\nfactually and legally.”). And the father lacks standing to challenge termination of\n\nthe mother’s parental rights or make arguments on her behalf. See, e.g., In re\n\n\n\n\n1  We review termination proceedings de novo.

So we do not consider his claim further.\n\n       Moving on to the mother’s appeal, we interpret the reunification component\n\nof her argument as a claim that the children could have been returned to her\n\ncustody at the time of the termination hearing. But that argument only implicates\n\ntermination under section 232.116(1)(f) and (h), not section 232.116(1)(e). We\n\ncould summarily affirm on this unchallenged ground.          See, e.g., In re Q.B.,\n\nNo. 23-2112, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 WL 707194</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (Iowa Ct.

In\n\narguing that reunification could have occurred at the termination hearing, as\n\nrequired by the fourth element of those paragraphs, the mother claims she\n\n“reengaged in some amount of mental health counseling,” she “had completed a\n\nseries of independent [urinalysis tests] to show sobriety,” and “there were not\n\nongoing concerns of domestic violence . . . as the father was incarcerated and\n\nthere was a no-contact order preventing him from being in the presence of the\n\nchildren.”      See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Iowa Code § 232.116</span><pre class=\"inline\">(1)(f)(4), (h)(4); In re D.W., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4249733\"><a href=\"/opinion/4472480/in-the-interest-of-dw-minor-child-amw-mother/#707\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In The Interest Of D.W., Minor Child, A.M.W., Mother\">791\n\nN.W.2d 703, 707</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2010) (interpreting “present time” to mean “the time of the\n\ntermination hearing”). This is a rose-colored view of the facts, to say the least.\n\n       The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services first became involved\n\nwith the family in May 2020 after the father assaulted the mother in front of the two\n\noldest children. While being treated at the hospital for her injuries, the mother\n\f                                         4\n\n\ntested positive for amphetamines, and she admitted to recent methamphetamine\n\nuse. The father was arrested and charged with multiple crimes for the assault. A\n\nno-contact order was entered in June (even though one was already in effect at\n\nthe time of the assault) prohibiting the father from having contact with the mother\n\nor the children. The two children were later removed from the mother’s custody\n\nand adjudicated in need of assistance. They were eventually returned to the\n\nmother’s custody, and the case closed in April 2022.\n\n       Just three months later, the department learned the mother tested positive\n\nfor methamphetamine at a doctor’s appointment. She was twenty-seven weeks\n\npregnant with her third child with the father.2     The department launched an\n\ninvestigation and found the father in the family home. He was arrested for violating\n\nthe no-contact order still in effect. The mother agreed to allow the maternal\n\ngrandmother, who lived in Arkansas, to care for the children. A few weeks later,\n\nthe mother assaulted the grandmother and fled with the children. They were found\n\nat a motel in Iowa in early September. The two children were removed from the\n\nmother’s custody, and one of them tested positive for methamphetamine. They\n\nwere adjudicated in need of assistance later that month.\n\n       The mother entered inpatient treatment for her substance use in late\n\nSeptember.    She tested positive for methamphetamine at admission.            The\n\nyoungest child was born a few weeks later. The State filed a child-in-need-of-\n\nassistance petition for him in October, although he was allowed to stay with the\n\n\n2 Besides the three children at issue here, the mother has five older children with\n\nother men. Her parental rights to three of those children were terminated, two in\nNew York and one in Arkansas. She gave a fourth child up for adoption at birth.\nAnd a fifth child is in the full custody of that child’s father in another state.\n\f                                            5\n\n\nmother at her treatment facility.

See W. Va. R. App. P. 21.\n\n        In July of 2021, the DHHR filed a petition alleging that the parents’ home lacked electricity\nand water. Upon investigation, Child Protective Services (“CPS”) observed the children to be dirty\nand the home in disarray, including broken windows, an extension cord running from across the\nstreet to power a television, and no refrigerator or stove. CPS implemented a safety plan with\nservices for the parents, but petitioner tested positive for THC while subject to the plan. The\npetition also alleged, among other issues, that petitioner suffered from untreated mental health\nissues and that there was domestic violence in the home.\n\n        During a hearing in September of 2021, the court accepted petitioner’s stipulation to\nallegations in the petition and adjudicated her of abusing and neglecting the children. The\nfollowing month, the DHHR filed case plans outlining the steps petitioner needed to take to remedy\nthe conditions of abuse and neglect. This included providing a safe and stable living environment\nfor the children, refraining from abusing drugs, submitting to drug screens, addressing substance\nabuse through Family Treatment Court or outpatient counseling, participation in parenting classes,\nand weekly visits with the children. Over the next several months, petitioner refused to submit to\na drug screen and tested positive on several occasions, including one positive screen for cocaine.\nPetitioner also submitted to a psychological evaluation, during which she blamed the father for\npreventing her from seeking therapy. Despite expressing displeasure with the father’s conduct, the\n\n       1\n        Petitioner appears by counsel Zachary K. Whitten. The West Virginia Department of\nHealth and Human Resources (“DHHR”) appears by counsel Attorney General Patrick Morrisey\nand Assistant Attorney General Brittany Ryers-Hindbaugh. William O. Huffman appears as the\nchildren’s guardian ad litem.\n       2\n       We use initials where necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case. See\nW. Va. R. App. P. 40(e).\n                                                 1\n\fmother “stated that she had no reason to fear for herself at home.” The psychologist concluded that\npetitioner had poor insight and judgment and “appeared to have little understanding of the\nrelationship between her emotions, cognitions, and behaviors.” Ultimately, petitioner’s prognosis\nfor improvement was “poor,” given that “she is likely to terminate therapy prematurely when\nexternal pressures are removed because she has little insight into the cause of her problems.”\nAccordingly, the psychologist recommended that petitioner’s “exposure to her children should\nremain limited and supervised.”\n\n         The court held a final dispositional hearing in June of 2022, during which several of\npetitioner’s service providers testified. The court heard testimony that petitioner’s drug screens\nhad been negative “for some time,” although the provider who administered the screens further\ntestified to petitioner’s disclosures of ongoing domestic violence. Specifically, petitioner showed\nthis provider bruising on her body and stated that the father hit her. The provider advised petitioner\nthat she needed to leave the father, but petitioner stated that the father prevented her from doing\nso. Over the course of the dispositional hearing, at least three providers testified to their efforts to\nassist petitioner in separating from the father. Multiple providers took petitioner to the Stop\nAbusive Family Environments (“SAFE”) domestic violence shelter, which provides shelter, meals,\ntransportation, and therapeutic referrals to domestic violence victims. However, on at least three\noccasions, petitioner left the shelter and resumed her relationship with the father. According to one\nprovider, petitioner would only stay at the shelter for a few days, despite being permitted to remain\nthere as long as she needed. One provider explained that she and other service providers talked to\npetitioner about domestic violence “on a regular basis.” However, one provider testified that\npetitioner “took no ownership of [her] situation and that someone else was always to blame.” A\nprovider also testified that petitioner threatened that she could take the children from the provider\nat any time.\n\n        The court also heard from petitioner’s parenting and life skills provider, who testified that\npetitioner was initially receptive to mental health treatment but changed her mind because the\nfather did not want her to submit to the treatment. According to this witness, CPS initiated services\nwith these parents in 2019 for issues of drug abuse and domestic violence. Despite the ongoing\nnature of the domestic violence between them, the provider testified that petitioner “maintained\nthat the situation would never change.” According to the provider, petitioner was aware of the\nseparation process, but qualified that “it is up to [petitioner] to take the first step.” However, the\nprovider testified that petitioner had “significantly regressed” since the closure of the prior CPS\ncase. This provider informed the court that she would be “livid” if the children were returned to\nthe parents and that the children would not be safe if the parents had access to them.\n\n        Another parenting provider testified that petitioner’s sessions were “not good” and that she\nmissed many scheduled sessions. In this provider’s opinion, petitioner made no progress during\nthe proceedings, given that the provider was “unable to conduct any effective parenting sessions.”\nThis provider also testified that she did not believe that petitioner desired to leave the father and\nwas unwilling to get help with her problems. Finally, a CPS supervisor acknowledged that\npetitioner obtained suitable housing and had not tested positive for any illicit substance since\nMarch of 2022. However, this witness testified that the DHHR recommended termination of\npetitioner’s rights because of her refusal to separate from the father.\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\f        Based on the evidence, the court noted that the “housing issues appear to have been largely\nameliorated,” although it also found that “[i]t is readily apparent that the [a]dult [r]espondents have\nno intention to sever their lengthy dysfunctional relationship for any meaningful period.” In fact,\nthe court noted that the parents were holding hands during the dispositional hearing. This was in\nspite of the DHHR’s numerous admonishments to end the relationship and their offer of resources\nto effectuate petitioner’s separation from the father. Citing the mother’s repeated rejection of the\nSAFE shelter and its resources, the court found that petitioner “demonstrated a clear lack of . . .\nfortitude for long-term meaningful change.” Based on her refusal to leave the father, the court\nconcluded that petitioner “continues to knowingly subject the children to [r]espondent [f]ather’s\ndomestic violence, as well as threats of physical, mental, and emotional injury.” The court also\ncited petitioner’s unresolved mental health issues and the resulting impairment to her ability to\nadequately parent the children. Based on the foregoing, the court denied petitioner an improvement\nperiod.3 According to the court, petitioner “had ample opportunities to correct the ongoing\nconditions of abuse and neglect,” but “squandered every chance” she was given. The court further\nnoted that petitioner failed to testify or present any evidence in support of her request, thereby\nfailing to satisfy the burden for obtaining an improvement period. The court also concluded that\nthere was no reasonable likelihood that petitioner could substantially correct the conditions of\nabuse or neglect and that termination of her rights was necessary for the children’s welfare.\nAccordingly, the court terminated petitioner’s parental, custodial, and guardianship rights to the\nchildren.4 It is from the dispositional order that petitioner appeals.5\n\n        On appeal from a final order in an abuse and neglect proceeding, this Court reviews the\ncircuit court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. Syl. Pt. 1, In re\nCecil T., 228 W. Va. 89, 717 S.E.2d 873 (2011). Petitioner raises two assignments of error\nchallenging the circuit court’s denial of her motions for improvement periods.6 Given that the court\nissued only one ruling addressing both motions,7 these arguments can be addressed together.\n\n\n       3\n         Petitioner actually filed two motions for improvement periods. First, she filed a motion\nfor a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the dispositional hearing, and then she filed\na motion for a post-dispositional improvement period after the dispositional hearing but prior to\nthe issuance of the dispositional order. The court made one ruling denying petitioner’s motions.\n       4\n        The court also terminated the father’s parental, custodial, and guardianship rights to the\nchildren. The permanency plan for the children is adoption in their current placements.\n       5\n        On appeal to this Court, petitioner does not challenge the termination of her parental,\ncustodial, and guardianship rights to the children.\n       6\n         Petitioner raises a third assignment of error challenging the circuit court’s denial of post-\ntermination visitation. However, she fails to provide any controlling authority in regard to the\nissue, in violation of Rule 10(c)(7) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Accordingly, we decline\nto address this issue.\n       7\n        Petitioner asserts in her brief that the court’s failure to rule on her motion for a post-\nadjudicatory improvement period at the adjudicatory hearing or otherwise acknowledge that the\nmotion was being held in abeyance was an abuse of discretion that requires reversal. Because\n                                                  3\n\fAccording to petitioner, she was entitled to an improvement period because she acknowledged the\nconditions of abuse and neglect by stipulating to her adjudication and because she remedied her\nhousing and substance abuse issues. However, petitioner ignores the ample evidence that she was\nunlikely to fully comply with an improvement period. Petitioner is correct that in order to obtain a\npost-adjudicatory improvement period, she was required to “demonstrate[], by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that . . . [she was] likely to fully participate in the improvement period.” W.\nVa. Code § 49-4-610(2)(B) and (3)(B). While it is true that petitioner obtained suitable housing\nand produced negative drug screens for several months, the evidence nonetheless indicates that\nher compliance with services was lacking. This is especially true when it comes to services\ndesigned to remedy the issue of domestic violence in her relationship with the father. Petitioner\ncites her multiple visits to the SAFE shelter as evidence of her ongoing efforts to remedy this issue,\nbut the circuit court found that her repeated return to the father evidenced a lack of intention to\nsever the relationship. This finding was based on testimony from several witnesses who did not\nbelieve that petitioner would end the relationship, in addition to the court’s own observation of\npetitioner holding the father’s hand during the dispositional hearing. Simply put, the evidence\nshows that petitioner failed to take advantage of the DHHR’s efforts and services designed to\nremedy the ongoing domestic violence in the home. As such, it is clear that petitioner failed to\nsatisfy the burden necessary to obtain an improvement period, and we find no abuse of discretion\nin denying petitioner’s motions. See In re Tonjia M., 212 W. Va. 443, 448, 573 S.E.2d 354, 359\n(2002) (permitting a circuit court discretion to deny an improvement period when no improvement\nis likely).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the decision of the circuit court, and its June\n29, 2022, order is hereby affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                                             Affirmed.\n\nISSUED: April 25, 2023\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice Elizabeth D. Walker\nJustice Tim Armstead\nJustice John A. Hutchison\nJustice William R. Wooton\nJustice C. Haley Bunn\n\n\n\n\npetitioner fails to cite to any authority in support of this assertion, in violation of Rule 10(c)(7) of\nthe Rules of Appellate Procedure, and because the court did, in fact, rule on her motions for\nimprovement periods in the dispositional order, we decline to address this issue.\n                                                   4\n\f",

See W. Va. R. App. P. 21.\n\n        In July of 2021, the DHHR filed a petition alleging that the parents’ home lacked electricity\nand water. Upon investigation, Child Protective Services (“CPS”) observed the children to be dirty\nand the home in disarray, including broken windows, an extension cord running from across the\nstreet to power a television, and no refrigerator or stove. CPS implemented a safety plan with\nservices for the parents, but petitioner tested positive for THC while subject to the plan. The\npetition also alleged, among other issues, that petitioner suffered from untreated mental health\nissues and that there was domestic violence in the home.\n\n        During a hearing in September of 2021, the court accepted petitioner’s stipulation to\nallegations in the petition and adjudicated her of abusing and neglecting the children. The\nfollowing month, the DHHR filed case plans outlining the steps petitioner needed to take to remedy\nthe conditions of abuse and neglect. This included providing a safe and stable living environment\nfor the children, refraining from abusing drugs, submitting to drug screens, addressing substance\nabuse through Family Treatment Court or outpatient counseling, participation in parenting classes,\nand weekly visits with the children. Over the next several months, petitioner refused to submit to\na drug screen and tested positive on several occasions, including one positive screen for cocaine.\nPetitioner also submitted to a psychological evaluation, during which she blamed the father for\npreventing her from seeking therapy. Despite expressing displeasure with the father’s conduct, the\n\n       1\n        Petitioner appears by counsel Zachary K. Whitten. The West Virginia Department of\nHealth and Human Resources (“DHHR”) appears by counsel Attorney General Patrick Morrisey\nand Assistant Attorney General Brittany Ryers-Hindbaugh. William O. Huffman appears as the\nchildren’s guardian ad litem.\n       2\n       We use initials where necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case. See\nW. Va. R. App. P. 40(e).\n                                                 1\n\fmother “stated that she had no reason to fear for herself at home.” The psychologist concluded that\npetitioner had poor insight and judgment and “appeared to have little understanding of the\nrelationship between her emotions, cognitions, and behaviors.” Ultimately, petitioner’s prognosis\nfor improvement was “poor,” given that “she is likely to terminate therapy prematurely when\nexternal pressures are removed because she has little insight into the cause of her problems.”\nAccordingly, the psychologist recommended that petitioner’s “exposure to her children should\nremain limited and supervised.”\n\n         The court held a final dispositional hearing in June of 2022, during which several of\npetitioner’s service providers testified. The court heard testimony that petitioner’s drug screens\nhad been negative “for some time,” although the provider who administered the screens further\ntestified to petitioner’s disclosures of ongoing domestic violence. Specifically, petitioner showed\nthis provider bruising on her body and stated that the father hit her. The provider advised petitioner\nthat she needed to leave the father, but petitioner stated that the father prevented her from doing\nso. Over the course of the dispositional hearing, at least three providers testified to their efforts to\nassist petitioner in separating from the father. Multiple providers took petitioner to the Stop\nAbusive Family Environments (“SAFE”) domestic violence shelter, which provides shelter, meals,\ntransportation, and therapeutic referrals to domestic violence victims. However, on at least three\noccasions, petitioner left the shelter and resumed her relationship with the father. According to one\nprovider, petitioner would only stay at the shelter for a few days, despite being permitted to remain\nthere as long as she needed. One provider explained that she and other service providers talked to\npetitioner about domestic violence “on a regular basis.” However, one provider testified that\npetitioner “took no ownership of [her] situation and that someone else was always to blame.” A\nprovider also testified that petitioner threatened that she could take the children from the provider\nat any time.\n\n        The court also heard from petitioner’s parenting and life skills provider, who testified that\npetitioner was initially receptive to mental health treatment but changed her mind because the\nfather did not want her to submit to the treatment. According to this witness, CPS initiated services\nwith these parents in 2019 for issues of drug abuse and domestic violence. Despite the ongoing\nnature of the domestic violence between them, the provider testified that petitioner “maintained\nthat the situation would never change.” According to the provider, petitioner was aware of the\nseparation process, but qualified that “it is up to [petitioner] to take the first step.” However, the\nprovider testified that petitioner had “significantly regressed” since the closure of the prior CPS\ncase. This provider informed the court that she would be “livid” if the children were returned to\nthe parents and that the children would not be safe if the parents had access to them.\n\n        Another parenting provider testified that petitioner’s sessions were “not good” and that she\nmissed many scheduled sessions. In this provider’s opinion, petitioner made no progress during\nthe proceedings, given that the provider was “unable to conduct any effective parenting sessions.”\nThis provider also testified that she did not believe that petitioner desired to leave the father and\nwas unwilling to get help with her problems. Finally, a CPS supervisor acknowledged that\npetitioner obtained suitable housing and had not tested positive for any illicit substance since\nMarch of 2022. However, this witness testified that the DHHR recommended termination of\npetitioner’s rights because of her refusal to separate from the father.\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\f        Based on the evidence, the court noted that the “housing issues appear to have been largely\nameliorated,” although it also found that “[i]t is readily apparent that the [a]dult [r]espondents have\nno intention to sever their lengthy dysfunctional relationship for any meaningful period.” In fact,\nthe court noted that the parents were holding hands during the dispositional hearing. This was in\nspite of the DHHR’s numerous admonishments to end the relationship and their offer of resources\nto effectuate petitioner’s separation from the father. Citing the mother’s repeated rejection of the\nSAFE shelter and its resources, the court found that petitioner “demonstrated a clear lack of . . .\nfortitude for long-term meaningful change.” Based on her refusal to leave the father, the court\nconcluded that petitioner “continues to knowingly subject the children to [r]espondent [f]ather’s\ndomestic violence, as well as threats of physical, mental, and emotional injury.” The court also\ncited petitioner’s unresolved mental health issues and the resulting impairment to her ability to\nadequately parent the children. Based on the foregoing, the court denied petitioner an improvement\nperiod.3 According to the court, petitioner “had ample opportunities to correct the ongoing\nconditions of abuse and neglect,” but “squandered every chance” she was given. The court further\nnoted that petitioner failed to testify or present any evidence in support of her request, thereby\nfailing to satisfy the burden for obtaining an improvement period. The court also concluded that\nthere was no reasonable likelihood that petitioner could substantially correct the conditions of\nabuse or neglect and that termination of her rights was necessary for the children’s welfare.\nAccordingly, the court terminated petitioner’s parental, custodial, and guardianship rights to the\nchildren.4 It is from the dispositional order that petitioner appeals.5\n\n        On appeal from a final order in an abuse and neglect proceeding, this Court reviews the\ncircuit court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. Syl. Pt. 1, In re\nCecil T., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2506080\"><a href=\"/opinion/2506080/in-re-cecil-t/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In Re Cecil T.\">228 W.

Petitioner raises two assignments of error\nchallenging the circuit court’s denial of her motions for improvement periods.6 Given that the court\nissued only one ruling addressing both motions,7 these arguments can be addressed together.\n\n\n       3\n         Petitioner actually filed two motions for improvement periods. First, she filed a motion\nfor a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the dispositional hearing, and then she filed\na motion for a post-dispositional improvement period after the dispositional hearing but prior to\nthe issuance of the dispositional order. The court made one ruling denying petitioner’s motions.\n       4\n        The court also terminated the father’s parental, custodial, and guardianship rights to the\nchildren. The permanency plan for the children is adoption in their current placements.\n       5\n        On appeal to this Court, petitioner does not challenge the termination of her parental,\ncustodial, and guardianship rights to the children.\n       6\n         Petitioner raises a third assignment of error challenging the circuit court’s denial of post-\ntermination visitation. However, she fails to provide any controlling authority in regard to the\nissue, in violation of Rule 10(c)(7) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Accordingly, we decline\nto address this issue.\n       7\n        Petitioner asserts in her brief that the court’s failure to rule on her motion for a post-\nadjudicatory improvement period at the adjudicatory hearing or otherwise acknowledge that the\nmotion was being held in abeyance was an abuse of discretion that requires reversal. Because\n                                                  3\n\fAccording to petitioner, she was entitled to an improvement period because she acknowledged the\nconditions of abuse and neglect by stipulating to her adjudication and because she remedied her\nhousing and substance abuse issues. However, petitioner ignores the ample evidence that she was\nunlikely to fully comply with an improvement period. Petitioner is correct that in order to obtain a\npost-adjudicatory improvement period, she was required to “demonstrate[], by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that . . . [she was] likely to fully participate in the improvement period.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">W.\nVa. Code § 49-4-610</span><pre class=\"inline\">(2)(B) and (3)(B). While it is true that petitioner obtained suitable housing\nand produced negative drug screens for several months, the evidence nonetheless indicates that\nher compliance with services was lacking. This is especially true when it comes to services\ndesigned to remedy the issue of domestic violence in her relationship with the father. Petitioner\ncites her multiple visits to the SAFE shelter as evidence of her ongoing efforts to remedy this issue,\nbut the circuit court found that her repeated return to the father evidenced a lack of intention to\nsever the relationship. This finding was based on testimony from several witnesses who did not\nbelieve that petitioner would end the relationship, in addition to the court’s own observation of\npetitioner holding the father’s hand during the dispositional hearing. Simply put, the evidence\nshows that petitioner failed to take advantage of the DHHR’s efforts and services designed to\nremedy the ongoing domestic violence in the home. As such, it is clear that petitioner failed to\nsatisfy the burden necessary to obtain an improvement period, and we find no abuse of discretion\nin denying petitioner’s motions.
